<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I.<br />
<span class="smaller">A CITY WITHOUT A STREET.</span></h2>

<p class="center no-indent">“To know a man well you must learn his city.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are three districts in Soot
City: By the Bridge, By the
Tracks, and the Stonepastures.</p>

<p>Simeon Quarry&mdash;who lived with
the Buttes By the Tracks, and who
knew more of this story than I do&mdash;always
began the tale of his town
with this phrase, “As way back as
‘30”; for that was the year when
the big birds sitting on the big
boulders first watched the strangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
with the strings and water levels,
and heard the strangers’ words.</p>

<p>There abode in the wilderness
of those days&mdash;for everything was
Stonepastures then&mdash;a Methodist
preacher with a taste for the scripturally
obscure. His circuit included
the site of Soot City, to
which place he gave the name of
Padan-Aram, which endures as the
county name until to-day.</p>

<p>Among the strange words the
birds heard were “ile,” “iron,” and
“smelt-oven.” These sounds were
each an “open sesame” to hordes
of foreign workers, with a proportion
of native Americans generalled
by Jo Bentley&mdash;grandfather of the
Bentley whose plant is still the first
in Soot City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>In a single lustre there sprang
from the arid strip of country confined
with treeless hills&mdash;“Baldhead
Rangers” and “Cleanshorns”&mdash;rows
on rows of mean houses, containing
men and women every year lessening
their acquaintance with the
world without. Soot City was their
cradle, the arena of their endeavour,
their deathbed, and their sepulchre.</p>

<p>By the Bridge dwelt foreman,
bookkeepers, furnace masters, together
with the Bentleys’ outdoor
servants&mdash;for they had a great place
now. The son had rowed in the
Cambridge boat, the daughters had
become Episcopalians and gave
great house parties, and the people
By the Bridge who knew them best
were the lawyer, the doctor, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>baker, and the undertaker, who
conspired against the rest of humanity
as occasion permitted.</p>

<p>Soot City has no street. Instead,
it has narrow-gauge tracks,
along which the workmen go forth
to and return from labour in the
empty ore cars. The houses By
the Tracks are ranged on either
side of them, and are inhabited by
mechanics, iron workers, truckmen,
freight handlers, and preachers of
minor denominations.</p>

<p>Beyond the bridge are the Stonepastures,
and beyond these the ore
bed, the smelting place, and the
nutt and bolt factory. The bridge
straddles the tracks so that the
highroad may traverse the town,
and the narrow gauge runs from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>the gate of Bentley’s Place to the
ore bed under the bridge and over
the Stonepastures. The tracks are
only four miles long, joining the
main line at the furnaces.</p>

<p>No townsman ever looked at the
sunset, because it went down on the
Stonepastures. Every one’s sunset
was “over there”; and in the
mean hovels that stood out sharply
to the town gaze in an evening’s
afterglow dwelt men who had the
white-lead poison in their hands, or
who had been scorched in a blast,
or who, trying to preserve themselves
in alcohol, had failed.</p>

<p>The men were hungry and
chafed, wrenching themselves from
sleep of a morning to a dull day,
three parts thirst to one of hunger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>The children went to school and
learned to know their parents’
mistakes, bringing home bitterness
instead of bread. The mothers
washed rags in rusty water, prayed
and played with the children, or
picked up scrap-iron for the men
to sell.</p>

<p>Accident and sudden death were
about as frequent as night and
day. A squeeze between two ore
cars, or a tendency to slumber
on the tracks after a “cosey of arrack”
at Grigg’s drinkshop, meant
black on some one’s door-handle.
But the “blast” was the horror
that made the women kiss their
men with the fervour of the
last parting when they went off to
work at the ore bed. The blast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>was not famous for respect of
persons. It rarely killed, but its
victims were rarely cured. There
was a rocky stretch by the ore bed
which young Bentley was having
blown out for the town reservoir,
and the new iron vein backed
against it. Scarcely a blast had
been managed without some one
being thrown to the earth, mangled
with jagged stones&mdash;“the throw”
the men called them. It might be
that some one would fall with the
shock and find himself thereafter
deaf to everything but the “dumb
roaring,” and such a one would die
of what the unlettered Methodist
preacher said was “eternal injuries.”
The very children feared the blast.</p>

<p>There were, however, three things
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>that Soot City loved: Pay-day, Jarlsen,
and the cinder flare. At night
they would pause in their homeward
way from drinkshop or chapel or
Jarlsen’s neat sitting room, and look
toward the smelting furnace. And
as the blaze jumped into the yawning
sky they would bless its fierceness,
and look at the houses and
tracks standing out clearly, saying
along with their good-nights and
good-byes, “God’s lookin’ at cher,
Bill!”</p>

<p>For they named the light from
the dumped cinder “The eye of
God.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II.<br />
<span class="smaller">WEDDING GLOOM.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“Death doesn’t wait for a man to have his
laugh out.”&mdash;<i>Salt-miners saying.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is hard for people who have
never seen places like Soot City
to believe in natures like Emma
Butte’s and August Jarlsen’s. In
river cities the labouring population
may be augmented daily with
a load of tramps and paupers who
can travel on the river about as
cheaply as their own feet can take
them. No travel is as cheap as
river boating. River fares cost
much less than shoes, and no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>other cities have the shifting masses
that the river cities get.</p>

<p>This is not the nature of an inland
town whose mine or iron
vein is booming. No one leaves
it. What is usual with one man
may become the common talk of
his district, if he be an influence in
it. The vice of a member of the
town corporation is the sorrow of
the county. The men have gained
their livelihood at the hands of the
town; they nurse their birthplace
when its resource is threatened;
they work for it. Even as they
live by it they die for it.</p>

<p>In feeling Jarlsen was an American;
his ideals were American.
He went to church soberly, had a
bust of Lincoln on his mantel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>eschewed labour unions, and gave
away a third of the not too princely
stipend awarded him by the Bentleys
for his position of payman.</p>

<p>For all that, when the native
Swedes got very drunk of an
evening and, congregating By the
Bridge, swore in their high, unearthly
voices, he would be much
ashamed and wish and even urge
them farther. For he too was born
in Sweden, and said “y” for “j”
even yet, if the men hurried him.</p>

<p>His room was By the Bridge.
His wont was to ask the better set,
the more American labourers, to his
room of an evening. He then, like
King David, charmed them with a
harp. He would sit in front of the
stove on a packing-box covered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>with pinkish jute, and there play
and sing strange, sweet songs about
birds and lonely mountains, and
kings’ daughters and sad forests,
and immortality; for these are of
the kinds of songs that come from
the North.</p>

<p>Jarlsen’s generosity was remarkable;
for his countrymen are
money-getters beyond any non-Semitic
people. The knowledge
of the value of money is born in
them. There is a saying at the
ore beds that testifies to this: “A
Swede will go farther for a dollar
than an Irishman will for a drink.”</p>

<p>But when Jarlsen took Emma
Butte, in the face of the whole
town, the men of his acquaintance
marvelled greatly. If he were the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>man whom Soot City loved, Emma
was the woman who ruled it. She
“had not the class” that her lover
had.</p>

<p>Coming into the city as a child,
she had learned the less rough
speech of the town labour and
taken on herself the somewhat
milder manners of the people she
now saw. But she had never tried
to make a place among them; she
lived with her father, plying her odd
trade&mdash;she was a barber&mdash;and making
her oddest pennies in another
way, as shall be presently set forth.</p>

<p>In the lighter social semblance
of their town the Bentleys were
paramount. Their doings came to
the town ear somehow, and the
people followed their lead, if it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>were a possible thing for them.
For example, one of the clerical
workers By the Bridge had invented
an intrenching tool, a spade,
which had been adopted by the
army. As a consequence, he was
invited to eat at the Bentleys’
Place. On his return from the
feast he reported to his eager circle
that not only had the ground-floor
rooms been filled with people,
but that Miss Bentley’s bedroom
looked like an intelligence office,
so full was it of the maids of the
ladies below.</p>

<p>This detail of magnificence so
possessed the minds of the female
portion of the inventor’s acquaintance
that By the Tracks was drawn
on for Abigails. Male escort was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>frowned down completely. One
might return from a Soot City revel
with a man, but to go with one&mdash;if
he were not “steady company”&mdash;was
proof positive that there
was no quarter-dollar wherewith to
hire attendance. Emma was often
retained as lady-in-waiting, and
through this curiously pretentious
institution met and obtained Jarlsen,
as well as her fees.</p>

<p>Quarry boarded in the Butte
household. No one knew why.
He imposed on them always, and
made them uncomfortable with his
odd ways and bad tongue. His
board was paid intermittently and
with recurrent ill will. He was always
a stranger and equally an inmate.
He had a fashion of rapping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>at Emma’s window (her room was
on the ground floor) and complaining
to her of slights imposed on him
by members of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>She felt him to be the only man
life had shown her whose faults were
not condoned by a liking for herself.</p>

<p>Every Sunday found her in a
leather apron giving Quarry his
Sunday morning’s dram of sweetened
rum in his tea, to keep him
quiet through shaving hours. He
came from Ryde, Isle of Wight,
and drank tea to the memory of his
old home, which had long since forgotten
him.</p>

<p>Then Emma would get to work.
Her apron was of red leather
hemmed up with brass-topped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>nails. It had a pocket lined with
tin, where her lather brush was put
when she took the razor from under
the straps on her left sleeve to
stroke a labourer’s jowl. Her lips
would be pressed together tightly
then, her curling hair caught back
with a round comb, like a child’s.
When she lathered she talked and
laughed, but when she shaved she
was silent.</p>

<p>Jarlsen shaved himself latterly,
and no one understood it but
Emma. All the men thought she
“had a fluke and struck ile, when
she was just digging for potatoes.”
That she, in the exercise of her odd
function, should have secured Jarlsen
seemed to them a wonderful
thing. But it was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Emma was a very good woman,
and that is just the same as a lady
to men of Jarlsen’s make.</p>

<p>He had begun to shave himself
the day he felt he loved his barber.
The town discovered his feelings
the very day he did, and promptly
prophesied trouble. “Jest es soon
es he felt like marryin’ her he
should hev broke her into shavin’
weekdays, an’ kep’ a clean chin on
him all the time,” was what every
one said.</p>

<p>Of course, in the eyes of her
townspeople Emma put on airs
also, for she took to going to
church. She never went so far as
to stand during the singing, for that
would have cost her all her trade.
No one stands up in the extremely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>unorthodox Methodist chapel Soot
City operatives affect, except those
who are converted or those desiring
the prayers of converts.</p>

<p>Now, Jarlsen stood always and
was never criticised. His friends
said he could sing better if he
stood. No one ever asked him if
this were true, because they were
sure he would say it was not. Thus
it may appear that Soot City was
not religious, except at blast rites
and funerals.</p>

<p>Emma’s heart grew mellow with
his singing as she sat beside him.
She loved him dearly, as young
women do love the men who enrich
their lives; there was a large
element of gratitude in what she
felt. She never talked as the others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>talked about their men, for, as was
said, she was a very good woman.
And so she got the name of being
a lady. The others hated her,
and most of the men asked her
advice and acted on it.</p>

<p>On the eve of her wedding she
sat in her white pique wedding
dress, listening to the snarl of the
country fiddles as they were played
for the dancers. They snarled for
two reasons: they were not good
fiddles and they were not well
played.</p>

<p>The bride-elect was not to go into
the dancing room&mdash;erst kitchen and
tonsorial arena&mdash;until Jarlsen came
and led her thither. He was a little
behind his time, she thought, but
her serenity remained complete.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>There had been yet no clamour
of voices and no clatter of feet,
going the faster because so near
the last dance. She could hear
her name and Jarlsen’s. One man
told how he had gone to pay off
the extra men who were to be discharged
after the blast by the new
vein.</p>

<p>She remembered that Quarry was
on that detail as machinist. That
made her think it must have been
a long job, for Quarry’s voice carried
wonderfully, and she did not
distinguish it among the others in
the kitchen. Her mind wandered
to the consideration of the capabilities
of her shaving apron as a
cover for the packing-box her lover
sat on when he played. That suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
to her the probability she
should never shave again, and that
no woman would dare after her
marriage to stand in her doorway
and say in venomous admiration,
“How elegant you shave!” They
had done it often heretofore, God
knew.</p>

<p>Her window was raised slightly,
and some one tapped on the jamb.
She turned her head at this usual
intrusion. “Come off, Quarry!”
she said hotly.</p>

<p>He came in through the window
and stood by the door. “It’s a real
pity Jarlsen’s late,” he answered.
His voice was hard and nasal, the
most effective voice for taunts.</p>

<p>“Is he late?” she asked more
crossly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Quarry laughed. “I guess,” he
said, “you knew he was late before
it would have been quite time for
him to come. You know the listening
heart worries terrible they
say, and you ain’t got no call to be
so high with me. You can hear
them girls in the kitchen laughin’
at you, same’s I do. I guess Jarlsen’s
getting tired, maybe. He’s
kinder in demand, seein’ he’s the
only fellow that’s kep’ his complexion
in the whole plant.”</p>

<p>Emma grew rather white. “Stop
your nasty tongue!” she cried imperatively.
“You’re always lying!
Your face is lying and your eyes
can’t see straight. You let what
people do to me alone, or you’ll
have business of your own to settle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>If I was a man, and couldn’t get a
respectable girl to marry me because
I was a liar and she hated
me, I’d let her alone for shame’s
sake, when she took up with a man
who can tell the truth.”</p>

<p>Her voice sounded very loud in
her ears as she stopped; for the
two fiddles were still, and there was
no talking among the dancers.</p>

<p>Quarry opened the door as if
some one had knocked, and looked
out. His features acquired a sudden
prominence as the colour flew
from his face. Fear crept into Emma’s
eyes while she looked at him,
shaking with his shadow on the
half-open door.</p>

<p>She forgot him in the great cry
that burst from the other room. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>was a horrified, helpless cry, that
gave place to a shocked silence.</p>

<p>She wrenched the door back and
stood on the threshold in her white,
scant gown of mechanic’s bride’s
finery. Her attitude showed faintness,
and her head hung down for
lack of courage.</p>

<p>The two fiddlers were kneeling,
with their tears streaming like rain;
they were Polacks, and knelt in
gratitude for any excitement. The
other men were hushed and stern.</p>

<p>On the big table where the arrack
punch had been in company
with the less heady beer there was
a long, writhing hummock, covered
with burlap.</p>

<p>No form was discernible, but
Emma knew at the first strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>heart-beat that it was Jarlsen,
singed and crippled with a careless
blast, as many another had
been.</p>

<p>The women wailed at her, and
the men tried to stay her with
their rusty hands. Yet she went
forward, pity for him drawing her,
and did not pause until she looked
him in the face.</p>

<p>It was black. The hair was gone;
his teeth were fixed in the cracked
lower lip, and the eyes, once so
wide and bold, were pinkish seams
beneath the puffed-out temples.</p>

<p>The women had crowded to her
back. Their breathing was heavy
and in unison.</p>

<p>Emma leaned over him and said
softly, in a mother’s voice, “Do you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>hear me speak?” She raised his
head on her arm, but it settled back
on the table with a sharp crack. He
had not heard.</p>

<p>She scanned him closely. She
had not yet the full sense of this
man covered with burlap and disabled;
she only knew that it was
not death. But now her lower lip
jerked down at the corners, though
her eyes were dry. The Polack
fiddlers drew each a long breath;
they saw the crisis of the scene
approaching, and were preparing to
bellow loudly.</p>

<p>Emma raised her head. “God’s
name,” she said, “he’s blasted!”</p>

<p>The women’s faces were curious,
inquisitive; and Quarry stood at her
side sobbing like a Polack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>The men who had lifted the
Swede in after the blast raised him
again, and laid him on the bed in
Emma’s room.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BLAST RITE.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“Sometimes if you make ready for bad luck
it doesn’t come.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one in Soot City was surprised
at a funeral for a man yet in
the flesh. Such rites were a custom
in the terrible, black little town,
where the birds flew low for the
damp of steam and the prevalence
of soot in the air, and where any
fine man who took life eagerly in
the morning might be blasted at
the noontide snack.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian labourers gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>a tone to all the customs of the
town, as the Polacks gave an intensity
to all its dissipations. The
drink of expatriated Poland is
crude alcohol and water, and their
drunkenness is a restless insanity
that would be murderous in a less
childish people. One idea that is
directly referable to the Swede
minds is that which gave rise to
the blast rites. Their feeling had
become general that a man might
“get beyond the blast”&mdash;that is, get
over its scorch and shock&mdash;if only
his friends could be brought to behave
as if he were really dead.</p>

<p>Emma was more than Norse in
her superstitious observances. She
would put a handful of soil from
her bit of garden into her wedding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>shoes, just like any tow-headed bride
in the Swede quarter. This was
called “getting the favour of home.”
It was very solemn, and often followed
by hysterics.</p>

<p>But the circumstances of Jarlsen’s
mishap favoured the idea of
complete death. He had left a paper
with his landlord, “Wavering
Jim,” providing for Emma in case
of “death, accident, or blast.” It
wasn’t a legalized proceeding, but
the ignorance of Soot City respected
writing beyond most
things, and no one would dispute
a paper with names signed to it.
The three hundred dollars coming
thus yearly to Emma would mean
a great deal of comfort to her.</p>

<p>The blast rite was to be at Emma’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
house, as Jarlsen’s body was as
much an essential to it as if there
could have been a sequent interment.
The men came in and out
a good deal and whispered as to
how to tell Emma of her legacy,
for every one felt it would be unbecoming
to force the news on her.
The way in which they broke it to
her would have been tactful even
for gentlemen.</p>

<p>Wavering Jim came down the
tracks in an ore car that sided by
the Buttes’s gate every night. He
didn’t get out of it, but waved his
hand to her. Emma guessed that
he wanted to say something in private,
and went to the gate to hear
it. “Well,” he said, “the weather
ain’t stopped bein’ fine, cert’in’y.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>Emma knew it must be something
very important to call for a
preamble as ornate as this remark
about the weather.</p>

<p>Jim paused and looked about
him. “Quarry ain’t in,” said Emma
instinctively. “Emma,” he said,
“I’m stone sure you’re frettin’
yourself into a terrible chafe ’bout
gettin’ Mr. Jarlsen proper accommodations,
regardin’ soup, soft
victual, and invalid’s board generally.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes bulged with apprehension.
“We don’t want no subscription
papers for us, and if Miss
Bentley sends her soup here I’ll
water the flowers with it. We ain’t
no Stonepasture poverty yet, to
drink the dishwater outer By the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>Bridge kitchen. He can’t eat
nothing but what I get and
cook.”</p>

<p>“Now jest dry up, Emma Butte,”
said Jim very gently; “old sheep
Bentley with her soup and her
weepin’ ain’t goin’ to come soothin’
and scratchin’ ’round this yard. Jarlsen
left a little paper with me that
fixes that. All that you’ve got to
do is to practise your signature on
his papers in the presence of a few
old friends. He grabbed considerable
’fore he was taken,” said Jim
sympathetically. Leaving the car,
he walked nimbly down tracks. No
one understands the Godsend news
is, in a labouring community. Jim
felt elated that he had lodged a man
who had money to look after. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>vicarious business transaction was
the biggest in his life.</p>

<p>Then the undertaker called that
evening. He made the same announcement.
Small and sympathetic,
he threw a cheerfulness into
all his sombre doings. He was a
rarely lovely man, and had as little
jealousy as a sleeping child. He
attended blast rites where he never
made a penny, as faithfully as he did
funerals whereby he supported himself
and his friends.</p>

<p>His family were four striped cats.</p>

<p>He was extremely fond of
prayers and hymns, and, consequently,
women. The men never
guessed it of him. They knew
that he would lend money, but
had not yet discovered that, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>they been able to repeat a sacred
stanza, they need not have repaid
him.</p>

<p>Emma’s heart beat fast with gratitude
when Jeremy Black kissed
her. She felt all along that one
of the women might have done
so, and it added to her uneasiness
about Quarry’s visiting, for he would
look at her and smile, and then wag
his shaggy head, as he had always
done when he had been about the
Tracks telling lies.</p>

<p>She held little, black-coated Jerry
very close to her, as disappointed
children hug the family cat or dog.
The day before she had gone in to
kiss Jarlsen, but his poor face was
sore with scorch and his side was
bruised from where the blast threw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>him. So she had spread her longing
hands over him in realization
that the women wouldn’t love the
barber and that her man couldn’t
see her sorrow.</p>

<p>Jeremy was immensely pleased
with her. He came soon to the
subject of the blast rite, and arranged
it in his deprecating way,
holding his barber’s brown hand
against his side and calling her
Jarlsen’s love names, but in a safe,
motherly voice that made Emma
sure she need not fear the women
even if they saw her with him.
“Now, Emma, you can’t get a regular
preacher to pray over anything
but a sure and cold corpse, so we’ll
get Quarry to say the sermon, alludin’
to past virtues and the future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
crown. It’ll make things right
with Quarry, who ain’t the Tracks’
darling just exactly, and I’ll take
the prayers myself. Then the Polacks
will fiddle and I’ll sing ‘The
land beyond the sky’ and ‘Peace
comes after pain’&mdash;that’s a nice
song, perfectly novel, with three
acts and a chorus. I won’t let on
it has a chorus, for them Polacks is
so insaturated with alcohol they
might get things noisy.”</p>

<p>“But do speak good and loud,”
said Emma, “for August might
hear something to please him.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Jerry, “don’t
you lose your grit. You kin never
tell how far a man will get beyond
the blast with good nursing.”</p>

<p>Every one knew that Jarlsen was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>stone-deaf since the blast, and Emma
spoke of his hearing the&mdash;in
one sense&mdash;post-mortem eulogies
from a desire to combat the idea.
Perhaps Jeremy feared she might
appeal to him for encouragement
on this point, for he hurried on to
the next.</p>

<p>“Since the beloved lips is silent,
I expect I’m the first singer in the
city. He had a way of doing gargles
on the upper notes that would
beat a seraph singing. But I’m
goin’ to organize as notional a rite
as I can, bringing forty years of experience,
man and boy, to bear on
this one sad occasion. It’ll be the
blasted best blast rite ever you saw.
It’s queer they can’t cover them
blasts or get the men off in time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>or so’s they won’t touch the torch
to it before the word’s given! I’ve
had some corpses in two years
from blasts, and all jest es ragged
and singed es could be, let alone
the blasts that’s lying deaf and
blind round the city yet!”</p>

<p>The day of the mock-death service
dawned clear and bright, which
was held to be bad by the weather-weird-wise,
as the Scotch among
them said. Quarry had rum in his
tea as early as 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> He was
always up early on rum days, but
he beat his own precedent this
morning.</p>

<p>He insisted upon setting the
house in readiness. He had formed
a habit of talking to himself since
he had grown fearful of committing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>himself with talking to the other
men, for Quarry had many things
to hide, and knew his limitations
as regarded discretion. His main
thought was that he would rather
spend money on what was only an
approach to Jarlsen’s corpse than
hoard it. Besides that, he had the
cosy consciousness that it had
looked friendly when he and Emma
had issued together from her
room on the night when Jarlsen
came singed to his wedding dance.</p>

<p>“The greatest thing happened me
since my first drink,” he kept saying
like a refrain, as he cut long festoons
of coloured paper to hang about the
mantel and the thinly gilt picture
frames. He went By the Bridge
to Jarlsen’s old room, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>still in some confusion, with his
working clothes tossed aside by
Wavering Jim. Jarlsen had folded
them neatly when he had donned his
wedding suit to go pay off the men.
It was Jarlsen’s portrait in crayon
that Quarry had come for. He tied
it up with a lank bow-knot of cheap
<i>crêpe</i>, and laughed in real mirth.</p>

<p>“Now, Jarlsen,” he said in banter,
“I do seem to see myself somehow
in the glass over your portrait.
Funny, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>By the Bridge he purchased five
sticks of pretzels, for in Soot City
long sticks are run by venders
through these open-work wares.</p>

<p>When all was ready at the
Buttes’s, he helped lift the big
Swede from Emma’s cot to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>kitchen table. He was dressed, of
course, in what was to have been
his wedding suit, and the odd
lengths of hair that were left him
were brushed out on either side
of his head to make a good show.
His beard had not grown on one
cheek, and Quarry surveyed him
with great satisfaction. “Seems
they’ve kind o’ singed them right-hand
glands where the hair starts
out,” he said. “It’s real hard to
keep your complexion right here.”</p>

<p>Emma had been sleeping on a
couple of ironing boards laid on
the hard clay of the lean-to where
the pans and scant house-tackle
were kept. The thought of hardship
had not occurred to her. She
had saved her heartbroken minutes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>for the sordid privacy of the chill
lean-to. The place had for her the
charm of liberty, which, we are told,
is the charm of paradise itself.</p>

<p>Her behaviour was not very agonized.
She crouched on the blanketed
boards and courted the slow
tears that crept from her eyes and
were healing to her hurt. They
alone relieved her; and sometimes,
when they would not come, she
would grip the scant old skirt that
covered her and pray in a loud
whisper, with the vital faith of the
poor.</p>

<p>When she woke on the morning
of the blast rite they had already
moved Jarlsen. He lay on the
table, roused, but baffled by the
strange dimness in him. No voices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>and no light could come into his
world except through memory; he
was heir to a limitless pain in the
sense of tyrannic suppression that
possessed him.</p>

<p>Etiquette assigned Emma the
place by the stove. She took it at
once as the mourners were gathering
rapidly. The company at the
wedding dance was indistinguishable
in the crowd of to-day.</p>

<p>There were many operatives and
all the foremen&mdash;of the new vein,
the nutt, and bolt factory, etc.
These last had their clerks in
attendance. Miss Bentley came
among the first arrivals, bringing
Emma sweet crackers and a hymn-book.</p>

<p>And Emma cursed her&mdash;a great,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>ignorant, insolent, heartfelt curse&mdash;because
she thought these things
could console her; things the
Misses Bentley would never offer
each other if their men had the
blast. But Miss Bentley was one
more of those devout women, not
a few, who, because of a congenital
shyness, can not do a kindness
kindly. Emma would have given
thanks for the same things given
another way.</p>

<p>The foremen also brought their
wives, worthy women with sleek
children, who consumed many pretzels
with a brisk crunching that annoyed
Emma greatly. She wanted
people to be sad and unable to
eat; to be upset with the trouble
that had faded out her future
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>with one too vivid moment of
pain.</p>

<p>Quarry sat at a table that was
covered with a white cloth. Upon
this lay a Bible and a bound time-table.
The fitness of this was in
the binding, which was ecclesiastically
purple.</p>

<p>The table was flanked by the Polacks,
looking wretched, as if they
had wept all night and grieved
since morning on empty stomachs.
They tuned their fiddles with writhing
faces, and played the “Land o’
the Leal,” as the remaining space in
Emma’s kitchen was being filled
with the less shy among the labourers.
The others stood at the
open windows where the sunlight
should have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Jeremy Black offered prayer, shyly
enough, for the Methodist minister
was attending as a layman. He
prayed for this and that, rather inconsequently,
and with a red face;
but Emma liked it better than anything
else in the service. It was
like her own prayer of last night:
“O Lord, thou knowest what I
want and what I don’t want. Please
don’t send me what I don’t want.
Good-night.” Even to God Emma
could not name Jarlsen’s death.</p>

<p>Her father came in at the climax
of Jerry’s petition. He shook his
head at Jarlsen’s big, quiet shape
on the table, and announced in a
voice that shook with emotion that
“young men would be young men.”
No one but Emma was galled with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>this needlessly irrelevant statement.
In the less book-learned phases of
life many people use expressions
just because they admire them, not
because they express their feeling,
their fancy, or a fact. It is no more
to be wondered at than the prayers
they make, which would read like
telegraphic messages in a High
Church congregation.</p>

<p>After his prayer Jerry sang. It
is confessed that he sang less for
art than for audience. He loved
to sing. His voice was thin and
rather sweet; his intonation very
sure and happy. He contrived to
infuse a wistfulness into the most
martial or condemnatory ballads,
types of song he particularly affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>There is always a good deal of
preface to singing like his, and he
was not above throat-clearing and
loud swallowing. The verse he
sang had been used at blast rites
since the Swedes came first to Soot
City. Its refrain was sung softly by
every one to an accompaniment of
rocking bodies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t fret, old wife, nor cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For God won’t pass you by;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He may come late, but if you wait,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You’ll get behind the sky.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Quarry rose with some
pomp and spoke thus: “Ladies
and friends: Some lives is all chair-cars
and champagne; some lives
is neither. I’m not saying what
they are, for this is no time to start
more tears. Some feels the whip,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>some wears the willow, some gets
their own way. These last says the
skimpiest ‘Glory be to God!’</p>

<p>“This house is a house of mourning.
The one ewe lamb went to the
pasture, and come home bit by the
wolf! Here to-day, there to-morrow!
Our God is a very fearful
thing!”</p>

<p>Quarry was considered an orator
in Soot City. He always spoke at
social functions and stirred his audiences.</p>

<p>“This man”&mdash;here the blackest
Polack snorted like the report of
firearms, and every one at the
sound burst into weeping&mdash;“this
man,” screamed Quarry, strengthening
his effect, “was a good man!
He knew ten at night as well as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>the town clock. He was a Christian
gentleman, and done as well
by his friends as he did by the
chapel, and what more can a man
do? In passing out, those that
knowed him good, or any of the
men that were pretty common
with him, can put their hands on
his hand, as some has the feelin’
it’s best.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Quarry made way for
himself to the kitchen table, and
stood striving against a triumph so
strong that it seemed a physical sensation.
And Jarlsen lay scorched,
inert, and blasted.</p>

<p>To any one knowing the old
Saxon custom of touching a corpse
as a means of finding its unconfessed
murderer the scene would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>have been more intense from the
moment that the first hand&mdash;a
woman’s&mdash;was laid on the least
sore member of Jarlsen’s wrecked
body.</p>

<p>None but Miss Bentley knew
that the custom was a primitive
habit of the race. She alone had
a vision of spurting blood as the
guilty hand touched its victim.
That vision was usual to her at
the blast rites, and she felt a
strange thrill of uncertainty when
she put her own innocent, helping
hand on a blasted labourer.</p>

<p>The greater part of the crowd
strolled off, subdued, into the bright
morning. The rest lingered to lay
hands on an old friend.</p>

<p>Jarlsen, the man who had given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>his ear to their sorrows and lent his
high, searching voice to all their
social joys, was virtually dead to
them; and it was in tense silence
that the heavy-footed workmen approached
the table. Then there
would be a sobbing sigh, and some
one would pass out at the door.
Few people can touch the dead
without tears, and as Jerry Black
said, “The blasts is dead men with
live tongues.”</p>

<p>They had all gone; the room
grew light as the crowd moved from
the windows. Sunlight bathed the
floor at Emma’s feet, and Black
stood beside her, knowing she
feared to be without him when
Jarlsen was deaf to her and Quarry
spoke his kind of love to her, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>her father was only a peevish old
child. Quarry laid a nervous hand
on Jarlsen, who had been roused
more than once through his tactile
sense as some old friend’s hand had
lain for a moment on his.</p>

<p>When Quarry’s touch fell on him,
he cried out, “O Emma, Emma!
am I dead, that I can not hear you?
Is your voice gone behind the sky,
that you hold your mouth yet? Is
your hand cut off you? Don’t
marry Quarry till I am home
again! Emma, tell me where you
are. It is all black inside me!”</p>

<p>Emma leaped to him. She was
“swift as a wicked cat,” Quarry
told her later on when he cursed
her.</p>

<p>She hurt him cruelly, but Jarlsen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>smiled, and his blackened face grew
brighter. “I shall not marry until
Heaven&mdash;” she vowed, but he could
not hear. The pain of her embrace
was fearful, but she clung fast, and
called out in her big voice the loyalty
he longed for and that he felt
in the suffering her strong arms
caused him, even though he could
not hear.</p>

<p>And then Jerry touched her.
“I’m afraid he’s fainted,” he said,
as though he apologized.</p>

<span class="smaller">QUARRY THE SCHEMER.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“The winged word of spite outstrips a kindness.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> was too tired to feel her
unhappiness, and too relieved, now
that everything was over, to feel
her loneliness very much. The
blast rite had somehow robbed her
of her hope of Jarlsen’s recovery,
and established the idea of his
death in her mind. Jeremy Black
nursed him at first, after her outburst.
In the neighbours’ phrase,
he “turned and fed the poor blast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Emma’s crude nature found a
pleasure&mdash;never before known to
her&mdash;in food, and in lying on the
lean-to floor and thanking God
that her barber days were over.
Her voice was harsh and loud; she
had always hidden it from Jarlsen.
To-day she sang and was not
ashamed.</p>

<p>Then Black went mysteriously to
the city. This might mean New
York, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, or
some nearer, smaller town than
either of these. He left at the beginning
of the drought, and Emma,
with the rest of his townspeople,
envied him sorely. Her resumed
service to Jarlsen was automatic.
He spoke, but she did not listen;
she was afraid of being hurt if she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>heard his words. The drought
made her double work, for her patient
drank a great deal of water,
and refused it with a wearied patience
if it were not cold. She
often went at noon to the Bridge
well, her tin dipper growing burning
hot beneath a sun that made
the mica specks shine in the roadside
dust. She lagged heavily down
the hill, the people greeting her and
she answering without knowledge
of what they said. She had learned
that forgetfulness is the better part
of wisdom.</p>

<p>She could not ignore Quarry;
he was merciless. On Sunday she
went at six for Jarlsen’s drink
from the well. She had a handful
of oatmeal to put in it; and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>as she leaned over and caught the
dripping bucket, she heard Quarry’s
voice in the alder thicket that smelt
sweet with the heavy dew on it.</p>

<p>“She’s a real good girl, and I
can’t help but feel, ef she could
let me at her wedding dance, set
alone with her waitin’ till Jarlsen
come, that I owe it to her to marry
her, and I think when she’s worn
out her mourning thet she’d be
agreeable. He was a queer fellow;
hed them fancy virtues thet prevents
a man from making a good
husband jest as sure as his havin’
the vices would. He give his
money to lame-legged and blind-eyed,
and thet’s keepin’ it from
wifie jest es much es if he give
it up for drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>A woman’s voice answered him
in full assent: “You’ll not be the
only one to marry her, though;
she’s got money now, and a rare
head for livin’ straight.”</p>

<p>Emma had not seen the woman,
but guessed it must be one of those
who “wrought” in the offices of the
plant, writing, or sorting the mass of
mail. Excepting herself Quarry
rarely spoke to any one of less class
among the women.</p>

<p>She was very angry, and could see
how Quarry had used it all in his
talk; all the circumstances of her
courtship he could twist into evidence
that she had loved nothing
of Jarlsen but what he had left her.
She could hear the woman’s opinion
that her conduct was not quite right,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>uttered in the dry tone she used
when speaking of her straight life.</p>

<p>She said to herself just as fiercely
as ever that Quarry was a liar, but
she felt that happiness had given
her the power to fight him, and
now her happiness was gone. She
remembered with a dim horror
that Quarry had resumed a practice,
since Jarlsen’s mishap, that she
hoped her engagement had ended.
Up to the day that they had spoken
of their marriage publicly, Quarry
would take things into his hands
that Emma had lately touched and
fondle them. He had done so
again the day of the blast rite, she
remembered.</p>

<p>She had intended to revel in her
grief at chapel that morning, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>Quarry had divined her intention.
She meant to stand in the singing,
as Jarlsen had stood, and sob when
the preacher shivered and scowled
and beat the reading-desk with his
fists. She would not go now. She
felt that no one would believe that
she mourned for him if Quarry had
been talking about her very much
in the way she had heard. She
burned to speak with him of the
traitor’s part he had played.</p>

<p>It was as usual in Soot City as
in other places for folks to bethink
themselves of the church when
trouble thwarts them; and so every
one went to church expecting Emma.
And Quarry’s tongue was not
quite long enough to have reached
the general ear in so short a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The congregation was very large,
and the flattered minister observed
Emma’s absence with satisfaction.
He never thought that his hearers
could have been ignorant of her
intention to stay at home, and
supposed that in the sudden calamity
come upon the town they had
found a warning anent churchless
ways. He announced an extra
service at three in the afternoon,
and the only person who answered
it was Jeremy Black’s foreman, who
came to protest.</p>

<p>After service Quarry went straight
to Emma’s room. He could not account
for her absence; he had intended
to sit with her in the front
pew while she stood in the singing.
He expected to colour his stories
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>with her behaviour and satisfy every
one that she had loved the money
Jarlsen left her the best of all his
attentions.</p>

<p>She was sitting with her charge,
who lay with his face turned away
from the sun&mdash;blind, maimed, deaf&mdash;yet
as conscious of Quarry’s presence
as when last week he had
turned to him with lazy scorn and
a short word.</p>

<p>“Emma,” said Quarry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, after a pause.
She had been wondering if he
could have been telling about the
money everywhere and “setting the
men on her.”</p>

<p>Quarry looked at her and at Jarlsen
with a twist in his mouth that
he thought of as “his smile.” He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>realized that he could insult Emma
thoroughly in the presence of a Soot
citizen who could not stir to protect
her.</p>

<p>“The women think you might as
well marry,” he said. “You’ve got
the fixin’s, and if you take me
you’ve got the husband. The
whole place expects a wedding
off you. You’ve got the extra
money to care for your friend
here.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather give up the money
than take you; besides,” she said
spitefully, “there’s better men nor
you in the town that knows I have
money for my man. You ain’t no
kind to love me after what I’ve had,
and I don’t want you should make
my love for this one shabby, talkin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>it over all the time. You can get
out,” she said very quietly.</p>

<p>Quarry went; and, as he said
himself, his heart was sour.</p>

<p>Then Emma stayed at Jarlsen’s
side and prayed in the hot afternoon
silence, and wondered why
God didn’t do something worth
while&mdash;that is how she thought it.
But she never doubted Him nor the
fate that He ordained, but rocked
in her only rocking-chair and kissed
her helpless lover boldly, longing
for a woman’s touch as a sick child
longs for its mother.</p>

<p>When Jarlsen spoke her name
she trembled with love of him; she
was awake now and filled with pity.
She did not answer, but, like a child,
prayed God to tell Jarlsen she heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>him call, and then slept till the coolness
of dusk awoke her. Jarlsen
slept a little while too, and told her
he had talked with her in dreams.</p>

<p>She got the supper, talking
within herself. “I can feel things
mend,” she said. “Every one will
come out right, and my big man
will live again and lick that terrible
scant Christian, Quarry!”</p>

<p>She ate her supper opposite her
silent old father. It was quite late;
they had candles and a lamp, which
was only an extravagance for courting-time
in the sordid social usage
of Soot City.</p>

<p>Emma had not thought of this
till Ben Bowa, the youngest foreman,
stood in the narrow doorway.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know to come in till I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>saw lights making the shine,” he
explained in Swedes’ English. And
then many more came in, and the
kitchen was full. Jarlsen cried for
water from the next room, and before
Emma could get to her feet
Quarry had gone to him.</p>

<p>“How can I show them I don’t
want one of them?” she thought.
There was no word of Jarlsen, and
everything went on as it had when
the one or two men courted her before
Jarlsen took her.</p>

<p>Bowa cut profiles out of paper
and asked whose they were, and the
other men performed their trifling
social accomplishments. They were
endeavouring to “raise a laugh”;
none came.</p>

<p>Late at night a wakeful neighbour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
heard Emma’s door close, and
later God heard her sobbing. “That
Quarry’s done me!” was what she
said.</p>

<p>And through the night her eyes
burned, and she felt that the darkness
fell like a weight on them.
She longed even for Miss Bentley
or the Polack girls’ overdressed
Madonnas.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOPE AHEAD.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“Only the saints and the feeble-minded suffer
gladly.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> tossed restlessly that night.
Once the cinder flare leaped upon
her walls, staining them with a flickering
orange glow. This incident
emphasized to her mind the horrid
blackness that had lately fastened
on their household.</p>

<p>She awoke very early next morning
in the final, nervous way that
worried people dread, and sat huddled
on the floor of the lean-to in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>the still, sunless cold. Jarlsen’s loud
talk echoed in the empty kitchen,
but she knew she could not wake
him with her voice. The thought
recurred to her with all the force of
discovery that, waking or sleeping,
the voices of this world were dead
to him.</p>

<p>Black would return to-day. It
was odd to call this hour to-day.
The noontide that would bring
Black again to Soot City seemed
very different from any dim time of
loud agonies like that which makes
the dawns of the sore-hearted.</p>

<p>To-day she would also be paid
the “blast money,” part accident insurance
and part Jarlsen’s savings.
The anticipation of this pleased her
until she moved into disordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>kitchen and saw the chairs as Bowa
and the others had left them, and
smelt the lamp that was a survival
of the courting days she had prized.
Then she groaned.</p>

<p>For a moment the idea of bringing
out the leather barber’s apron
and the keen razors, as a tacit contradiction
to any report of her
wealth, seemed a clear inspiration.
But with Quarry and Wavering
Jim to talk, she knew all delicate
denial to be useless.</p>

<p>She opened the house and sat
along the narrow doorsill, her back
to one jamb, her knees drawn up
and fixed against the other. As
the sun came up, the cinder flare
crept in a stealthy flush along
the earth and lost its power in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>the heavens as the day grew
bright.</p>

<p>At last the cold stung her hands,
and the sun chased the shivers
down her back, so that she went
again into the house, forgetting
that an hour since she had loathed
it. Quarry was with Jarlsen, who
clamoured on, asking questions
whose answers he could not hear.</p>

<p>He was learning his deafness by
degrees, for his fits of silence were
longer, but with Quarry he talked
always. Quarry’s touch was abominable
to the Swede, and his presence
pricked to the quick a soul
whose every other approach was
blockaded.</p>

<p>Emma, in pity, took up the jug
of sweet oil to bathe the burns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>Her hand was light from shaving,
and it had learned a wonderful caution
from the teachings of pain.
She could mitigate its brown
strength with a suddenness like
the swift softnesses of Jarlsen’s old-time
singing, and he would smile at
her as she used to smile at his own
skilled tunefulness. She almost
stroked the scorches with her wise,
soothing hands.</p>

<p>She had meant to spend the
morning on the doorsill, in the
hope that a passing woman might
be kind and glance her way. She
longed so for a woman’s friendship!
She was sure that half the sting of
her sorrow would vanish with recital.</p>

<p>At the last accident, when they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>brought home Jerry Black’s half-sister’s
husband from a squeeze between
the ore cars; as soon as every
one had made quite sure he was
dead, Martha Long&mdash;herself a personage
even in the presence of a
newly made widow&mdash;caught Jerry’s
sister in her arms and rocked to
and fro with her standing, until
both women fell on the plush sofa.</p>

<p>Such scenes dignify sorrow in
one type of the common mind.</p>

<p>Emma knew that Quarry had
lied about her, and through the
day she wondered what the lie
might have been. The absence of
feminine condolers worried her, and
added to her dread of the time
when the hands of the clock
should reach half past one. That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>was the hour of Jarlsen’s leave-taking
on the day before that set
for their wedding. As the time
approached the ticking of the clock
seemed louder, and she went into
the lean-to to escape from it. She
lay there, covered over and quiet as
though night had come.</p>

<p>The latch rattled, and Martha
Long, with her thin face and burning
eyes, stood in the lean-to doorway
with her baby’s half-knit hood
in her fingers. She cast a glance of
piercing inquiry at Emma, and her
emphasis was not conciliatory.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “God has
strange ways with the righteous.
You’ve had your troubles, poor
girl!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see there’s need for that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>kind o’ talk,” said Emma vaguely;
“them as gives it ain’t had overmuch,
I guess!”</p>

<p>“Well, no offence,” said Martha,
overbearingly; “how is he?”</p>

<p>“Making out&mdash;no more. He
ain’t got a piece of skin on him
that don’t appear to be fried, and
he talks till your heart splits in
your body.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good sign if he’s rebellious.
My brother was fearful meek.
He could hear a little, and the
whole town had hopes, when one
morning he turned his head in to
the wall, and he says to poor Jarlsen,
who was tending him, ‘You
give that oatmeal and water where
it’s wanted,’ he says; ‘you can
give me a pleasure drink for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>last I get.’ He didn’t drink much
ever, and Jarlsen give him a drop
of something, and then he lay still
and was dumb dead before your
poor feller could rinch the glass.
So it goes!” Martha ended dismally.</p>

<p>Emma did not find this quite
satisfactory, so she said nothing.</p>

<p>“And there is something you
have to be thankful for,” said
Martha further, forgetting that
nothing causes man to hate his
lot like telling him to be thankful
for it; “you’ve got a good man to
fall back on. That Quarry’s more
to you in most ways nor your born
mother would be. Yesterday he
was saying as how risky it was to
marry where the language was different.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Two tongues like that in
a house means secrets.”</p>

<p>Emma had started up. “That
Quarry says more than his prayers,”
she cried out fiercely; “I knew he’d
been lyin’ ’round about me. I don’t
hold by his ways; and I’m goin’ to
stick by that husk of a husband in
there, ef he don’t get better till the
day I die. He ain’t talked kind
about me, and worse talk is due, I
know, but I’ll bide my rights, and
have ’em.”</p>

<p>Martha felt admiration. Emma
was not as Quarry had reported
her. She recited a few more “incidents,”
and strolled, without leave-making
and still knitting, toward
the door. “Come in some night
when you’re lonesome,” was all she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>had left in her heart of the invitation
she had meant to give the girl
in Bowa’s interest. It was plain to
her woman’s eye that Emma loved
Jarlsen maimed better than a town
full of men of sound members.</p>

<p>She wondered, however, why the
girl hadn’t the sense to take Quarry,
who was getting in with the factory
hands like water through a
leak.</p>

<p>Black came in a moment after
Martha’s departure. He had a
wallet in his hand, and his face
was clothed in a bright kindliness
that turned Emma’s heart toward
him.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve had lady’s company,”
he said.</p>

<p>“You’re looking daft, dear,” Emma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
answered, when she had studied
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little fellow spread
his hands. “Last night,” he said,
“I went to heaven cheap&mdash;fifty
cents entrance fee. I heard a man
play on a fiddle; well, if the
sweetest voice in heaven sang its
best it couldn’t learn that feller
much. I sat there and just pined
away to hear the back door shut,
or some other shabby kind of
sound, just to show it was really I
situated in the concert hall. But
that’s not this,” he concluded, putting
his hand on the wallet; “here’s
your due.”</p>

<p>Jerry held it out to her. His
face was red, and he made visible
efforts to control its expression,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>which changed from conscious diplomacy
to kindly eagerness.</p>

<p>“I seen a doctor in the town, a
professor of blasts, kind of. He
knows the ins and outs and conbinizations
of paralysis pretty pat,
and I told him I had a good
friend laid up in a blast, and he
said he’d charge maybe a hundred
or maybe fifty dollars to come
up on purpose to see him. So
that’s your best way of layin’ out
his money, Emma.”</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ that would be
good myself,” Emma answered with
a quiver of gratitude on her lips.</p>

<p>“And I’m obliged to say that
you could offer a little to Quarry,
just to keep his tongue sweet.
He’s got a fearful gainin’ way with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>his mouth, and them nutt and bolt
hands will pick up and listen to all
he has to say. They’ve been in
schools, and are crazy for talkin’
and politics. The kind of foolishness
men gets from schools is the
worst kind.”</p>

<p>Jerry was angry.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he been talkin’ on me,
maybe?” Emma asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, perhaps no. He’s
so mean you could buy him for a
small price. He ain’t much of a
luxury.”</p>

<p>As they talked they heard the
dinner pails clanking as some of
the men came down the homeward
hill. Then an oar car sided
under the window close by the
house. In it were the workmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>of the nutt and bolt factory&mdash;Quarry
in their midst, his face ardently
conceited and his gestures
highly alcoholic.</p>

<p>Emma scanned him with a fierce
contempt. “He wouldn’t be like
that if he could stir around,” she
exclaimed, pointing toward her own
room door.</p>

<p>Then she stood by Jarlsen’s bed
to avoid Quarry, and as she looked
at him he laughed; it was his old,
mirthful, kindly laughter. It seemed
to the girl, who cherished him, that
he had brought pain to their house,
and had also been spared its consequences.
She suffered&mdash;he slept.</p>

<span class="smaller">A BAD BARGAIN.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“It is well to pay your debts, on the chance
you’ll lose your money.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> four days’ time Black received
a letter from the paralysis specialist
that delighted him. It consisted
solely of questions regarding trains
and Soot City conveyances and the
distance from the station to the patient’s
abiding place. To the genial
undertaker intercourse with a man
too busy to con a time-table was
social promotion.</p>

<p>He went at once to Emma, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>in a mixed state of reverence and
elation read her the physician’s curt
note, with his own copious comment.</p>

<p>“Sounds ’cute, don’t he?” said
Black. “He knows I understand
him. It must be a kind of comfort
to him comin’ to a strange
place to find a man of his own
stamp who feels just his way about
the game o’ life.”</p>

<p>Putting his tongue in his cheek,
he was soon lost in wonder to find
himself, after long years of comparative
obscurity, so very like this
shining light of medical science.</p>

<p>Emma almost said her thought
aloud; it was well she did not, for
she was saying inwardly, “You can
always tell when Jerry Black’s been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>to the city, he has such an extra
green look.”</p>

<p>With Martha Long for aid, she
prepared for the doctor joyfully.
They washed everything just for
the love of the unaccustomed,
that seizes women under suspense.
Everything had been washed for
the wedding, and was still much
cleaner than its ordinary state.
There was one day when the
house-cleaning was finished and the
doctor not yet come; so Martha
undertook a little rudimentary
cooking, and Emma raked up the
little space of yard and dug out
the weeds from the beds of cinder-spotted
marigolds.</p>

<p>She tended Jarlsen more and
more, and the friendliness Martha
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>showed toward her pleased her
mightily. She would take her to
the Swede’s bed and show her how
his looks were coming back, and
then, forgetful of her presence,
would stand in silent wonder at
the expression of wisdom fast becoming
habitual to him.</p>

<p>He seemed to know more of
what was, and is, and is to be, than
any of the people she had seen, and
he had not seemed so wise when he
had lips wherewith to speak wisely.
For a half hour and more she would
sometimes watch him, unconscious
of time, and at last a fit of longing,
like a mother’s, would bend her to
him. Anxious for his thoughts, she
would put her hand on his temple
as if feeling for them. He would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>smile and say “Emma”; then her
blushes would come as they had
when he was a bright mystery to
her, because she dared not raise her
eyes to his face; and she took the
utterance of her name as an answer
to her craving.</p>

<p>Quarry and her father had become
cares she could not shoulder;
she simply could not think of them.
Quarry never returned from work
without company, and he and his
friends would sit in the yard on
Emma’s chairs, which they carried
from the kitchen without her permission.
In a man she liked, this
proceeding might have been annoying;
but from Quarry it was a
liberty that was enraging.</p>

<p>One day Emma heard him stirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
up strife with his tongue; he
was a fascinating speaker, even
when&mdash;as the Swedes said&mdash;he
“talked beside his mouth,” which
is their idiom for conversational
embellishment.</p>

<p>She called him to her. “Send
them away,” she said shortly.</p>

<p>Without a word of dissent he
made them move, and Mr. Butte
shambled out to bring in the
chairs.</p>

<p>“Take them in yourself,” she
called wickedly. “You was strong
enough to get them out there.”</p>

<p>With a more sullen compliance
he put them just within the narrow
doorsill.</p>

<p>Still she eyed him with her
mouth stretched into something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>like a smile. “Put ’em in their
places,” she said.</p>

<p>Again Quarry obeyed her.</p>

<p>Then her contemptuous smile became
laughter. “You wouldn’t hev
done thet ef you hedn’t got wind
of what I’m goin’ to even to you.
See here&mdash;you talk too much.
Would you talk less if you had
more money? I guess maybe.
Here’s what you said at Martha
Long’s party. You showed how
it was a good thing August Jarlsen
got the blast, because I kind o’
leaned toward you latterly. And
as for you, you says you’d always
leaned toward me, and it was better
to have August Jarlsen saved
learnin’ it.” The girl covered him
with her tragic eyes, and expressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>her own strong instinct in a gesture
she had learned from the Polacks&mdash;she
crossed herself with a
rapid hand. She had never before
felt Quarry to be so evil. “Now,”
she said, “fifty dollars if you’ll stop
that!”</p>

<p>For a moment delight leaped from
his eyes. He threw out his hand;
then he looked at her darkly, his
expression altered to one of fear
and misgiving.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said finally.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll pay you later,” said
Emma, and every word she spoke
cut like a whip, her voice was so
shrill with contemptuous anger.</p>

<p>She was a young girl, and had
hoped he would not take the
money; partly because she didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>wish to believe that he could be
mean enough to take it from her,
when he knew that he was the last
person the Swede would give it to,
had he any longer the power to
give.</p>

<p>Her lips shrank away from her
teeth in contemptuous, writhing
smiles when she thought of it.</p>

<p>She scarcely knew how to array
herself for the doctor’s visit. She
wanted to impress him with a sense
of her fitness to nurse the patient.
She had had visions of Jarlsen’s departure
in an ambulance for some
city hospital, where a uniformed
woman would hear his groans and
heed them for hire only.</p>

<p>Quarry knew nothing of the
doctor’s advent. Emma understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
that he would talk about it,
and that her enemies would say she
must be sure of Jarlsen’s death
when she dared let loose a first-class
pill-man on him.</p>

<p>Then, besides, the Englishman
was unreasonable and iterative, like
many Englishmen; and she knew
how he would search his mind for
ways to tell her that Jarlsen was as
good as dead already. “I ought
to pay him right away, or he’ll
do a little of his fancy talkin’,
maybe.”</p>

<p>Black went to the station in a
funeral carriage, which was the more
imposing as there were but four in
Soot City. (Casually&mdash;he paid toll
on the turnpike for the eight horses
that drew these vehicles, and they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>were always taxed as “pleasure
teams.” Again casually&mdash;he saw no
joke in this, even when the mourners
received legacies.) He wore a
red tie with his black, professionally
sombre clothes, and this he did as
he would not imply Jarlsen’s death
to the doctor, in case the physician
should be standing on the platform
and should see him before he could
get speech of him. Black employed
his imagination in this sort of futile
arrangement of improbable circumstance.</p>

<p>On the doctor’s arrival they
drove directly to the Buttes. They
alighted at the Bridge and saw
thence to Emma’s doorway, where
Quarry was standing. He looked
as though he had had rum in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>tea, and as if even that had not
reconciled him to existence.</p>

<p>“Where’s Emma?” he asked of
Black.</p>

<p>“She’s in with August. Dr.
Brent, this gentleman lives here;
he’s an old friend of Mr. Butte’s,
and Mr. Jarlsen’s too, I may say.”</p>

<p>Quarry, returned in the noon recess
to find a perfect stranger about
to invade the house; did not understand
the situation, as was very
evident. He grinned absently, and
went toward Jarlsen’s room door.</p>

<p>“Emma, come out here.” His tone
was wheedling, and his fingers were
tapping nervously on the wall. She
came out to him quickly; her eyes
were bright and her face was full of
a vigorous hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Hurry up!” she said; “I want
to bring the doctor in.”</p>

<p>“Could you oblige me with the
trifle you named Thursday? I want
to blow it right in this noon.”</p>

<p>Emma thought it wise to pay
him at once, although her heart
was beating in her ears&mdash;she
longed so for the doctor’s opinion
on Jarlsen. She hesitated, and then
said: “It is in the wallet between
the shake-downs in the lean-to
chamber. Put it back where you
found it.”</p>

<p>She forgot him as she greeted
the doctor; her whole mind was
full of the Swede.</p>

<span class="smaller">TROUBLE ACCUMULATES.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“If you’re feeding a mean dog, be sure he’ll
bite you when he’s had enough.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> doctor let Emma tell him
her own complete narrative of Jarlsen’s
mishap; nor did he interrupt
once, save with questions that served
as a spur to her flagging memory.
Her mode of recital was detailed
and feminine, obnoxious to science.
She told, incidentally (but at great
length) how Jarlsen had always
treated her; and quoted his sayings,
which were, in her retrospective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
judgment, prophetic. The doctor’s
manner was so courteous that
a more experienced girl than
Emma could not have inferred that
Jarlsen’s relations with her before
the accident would not strike his
physician as indicative of his condition
after it.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent had a sober, inscrutable
smile; he gave the observer an
impression of seeing with great difficulty,
although he wore no glasses.
His manner was at times indifferent,
yet he inspired confidence. As
Jerry had said, “He don’t have to
hustle to cure you, like these farmin’
pill-men we hev to Soot City.”</p>

<p>Emma was so rapt in the first
uninterrupted recital of her troubles
that she did not observe Quarry as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>he crossed the kitchen to the house
door. He had the wallet in his
hand, which shook; his face twitched
and was chalk white.</p>

<p>“I hope that is not your father,”
said Dr. Brent politely as he would
say: “There is a shower coming; I
hope it may not wet you.”</p>

<p>Emma looked at him and liked
him, for she saw that he knew at a
glance what Quarry was. And she
had taken lessons in him for a lifetime
and had not learned him yet.
Then the doctor rose and went into
Jarlsen’s room.</p>

<p>Waiting for the doctor’s opinion
is one of the fearful things that civilization
has imposed on humanity.
It is during such intervals of suspense
that a racked mind learns the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>pattern of the carpet, the similarity
in outline of some familiar pieces of
furniture, and of some impossible
beast or bird sprawling on the wall
papers. Emma discovered stains in
the sheer curtains at the window.
She prayed in a general way, and
feared the moment when the doctor
should appear again.</p>

<p>For the first time she observed
that quite a crowd surrounded the
house, looking in at the windows.
They wore long faces beneath their
eager eyes, and looked as though
good news would be a (conversational)
calamity. Jerry Black, however,
stood among them with the
perfect aspect of honest sympathy.</p>

<p>It was to him that Emma beckoned.
He entered the house in response,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
with an air of great importance.
He had been telling half
the town by twos and threes, and as
a great favour, exactly what he had
said to Dr. Brent. The town listened
in the hope of hearing what
Dr. Brent had said to him.</p>

<p>Emma motioned him to stand
close to her.</p>

<p>“When do you pay?” said she.</p>

<p>“’Most any time,” said Jerry.
“You can pay the first day for a
whole set of visits, or you can pay
when he sends a bill, or ’most anyway.”</p>

<p>“How can I tell how often he’s
comin’?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t let pass that he’s comin’
more than this once, but you’ll
have to go high for this once.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>Think of the fares here and back;
the car money alone is twenty-five
dollars, and not countin’ chair-cars
or meals.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give him a hundred,
and see how he likes that.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jerry; “you
give it to him now. He’d be
more likely to come later, if he
knew we pay before he can put
hat on to go home.”</p>

<p>She had planned it all; the
money should be put in his hand
just as he was leaving. She
thought of no receipt, just as she
thought of none for the money
she put in the plate on those delightful
courtship Sundays. Indeed,
she felt the transactions to
be similar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>She wanted to show, just as she
had shown then, that though Jarlsen
was her man, he was no pauper.
The bill was to be paid in the sight
of the surrounding multitude at
the windows.</p>

<p>Presently Dr. Brent came out.
He looked at the faces set in the
window frames, and made no comment.
Emma realized, with hope
full grown to thankfulness, that had
he felt there was nothing encouraging
to say, he would have dispersed
the waiting men and women before
he spoke.</p>

<p>“Miss Butte,” he said, “I’ve seen
worse than he recover. His sight
is gone, sealed up with scorch; but
he’ll hear again some day. Get him
up as soon as the smart goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Some one in the window said,
“He’ll make wages dead easy if he
hears again.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said Dr. Brent, turning
toward the window. “Encourage
him to work when the smart is
over.”</p>

<p>He declined Emma’s offered meal,
and prepared for departure, writing
on a bit of paper what he wished to
have done for Jarlsen. When he
rose, hat in hand, Emma spoke to
him. Her voice had a thrill of pride
in it, and her high spirit lent a dignity
to the gaudy finery intended
to decorate her awkward frock.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” she said, “will you set
a minute?”</p>

<p>She entered the lean-to, erect and
elastic. Three minutes passed while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>the crowd asked the doctor questions,
which he answered in words
of such strangeness to their ears
that they enjoyed all the sensations
of those who communicate
with spirits. They laughed at his
least word, and he, perceiving it,
darkened his sayings the further.</p>

<p>When Emma returned, her face
was set and her cheeks flamed, so
that their heat alone drew the
tears to her eyes. Her hands
shook, and hardly held the bit of
soiled paper and the stumpy pencil
that she carried. “Will you tell me
your name and address?” she asked
of the doctor.</p>

<p>A sigh broke from her lips that
tried not to be a groan.</p>

<p>Black looked at her, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>colour flew from his face. He
said afterward that his heart beat
so that he thought some one
knocked on the door. He knew
what had happened.</p>

<p>So did the doctor. “My accounts
are payable in May,” he
said, being kind, and knowing Soot
City to be ignorant.</p>

<p>Emma smiled again, and, with
the patronizing manner that is the
outcome of complete shyness, said,
“Well, you’re a real good doctor.”</p>

<p>And so, with a slight constriction
of his kindly heart, he shook
her hand and departed.</p>

<p>But she caught Black at his
exit. “That Quarry’s stole!” said
she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Jerry looked sick and old; his
voice sounded bitter. “I ain’t got
a cent just now to spare,” he said.
Then he grew fiercer, and cursed
the Englishman exhaustively and
with the awkwardness of a man
unused to such conversational indulgence.</p>

<p>The crowd followed as far as the
funeral carriage and stood to watch
it disappear in billows of dust. The
white horses and the black barouche
were alike buff before they were out
of sight of The Tracks.</p>

<p>And in sullen quiet Emma set
herself to wait for Quarry, not
trusting herself to look at Jarlsen
lest the sight of him should soften
her hate.</p>

<p>“He took the whole wallet!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>she repeated to herself, “and he
was the only man August wouldn’t
give to. He knew it, too, or he’d
hev asked something off him when
first he seen we was settin’ it up
together.”</p>

<span class="smaller">QUARRY’S ATTEMPT AT EXPLANATION.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“A man will say more to himself in excuse
than he will to his God or his friend.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma’s</span> eyes roved from object
to object as though she sought
escape; they always returned to
the door, whence she expected
Quarry. It was a duty, she reasoned,
to turn this man’s stealing
to swift shame. Words flocked to
her tongue that she could not remember
having used before, and
her mind’s eye saw the Englishman
wince under them. A demon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>of invective filled her brain with
fierce thoughts as she tore the
shake-downs apart in a final hunt
for the wallet. And then a fit of
sobs and shaking beset her as she
waited again in the kitchen for
what she hoped would be in some
sort vengeance.</p>

<p>She remembered every mean
and, in her characterizing adjective,
every “useless” thing Quarry had
done; how he had lied, and when.
She remembered his drunkenness&mdash;that
terrible drunkenness in which
his self-assurance seemed boundless;
the remembered vanity of his face
startled her, and it seemed marvellous
that his faults had not kept
him from their household as they
had kept him from their hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>When some person has been the
provoking cause of emotions so
strong that the mind can not shake
off their grasp, it is quick to misconceive
that person. Quarry’s voice
was a shock to Emma when at last
she heard it in the yard, although a
short time ago she had seen and
had speech with him.</p>

<p>Her heart sank when she found
he was talking with himself and in
a laudatory strain. His effort was
to walk straight, but his accomplishment
was slight. He lurched
to and from either marigold border,
so that the walk seemed serpentine
to Emma’s shocked gaze. “No,”
he said, “the ruins is covered with
ivory; I shall pluck away the vine,
and the presspit is discovered.” He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>spoke as he walked, doing as much
as possible at each lucid interval
between lapses. “No friend shall
fall away into the presspit, like I
nearly did.”</p>

<p>His fall was upon nothing more
precipitous than the chair by the
door. Seeing anger on Emma’s
face, he attempted to soothe her
with vague smiles of fearful extent;
they travelled swiftly across
his flushed face and divided it into
north and south intemperate zones.</p>

<p>“Stop <i>that</i>,” called Emma; “you’ve
done enough!”</p>

<p>“Not yet!” shouted Quarry, impelled
by an erratic enthusiasm;
“I’ll do more for my Emma. I’ve
laid out the money real well. We’ll
buy the deepo and live in it! It’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>the finest house in Soot City, and if
you want Jarlsen too, you can keep
him for hired help. I don’t want
there should be any stinting where
love is king.”</p>

<p>“Give me my wallet,” said Emma.</p>

<p>“I have given it where it’ll do the
most good. The town rejoices that
a good deed was done. Mine the
deed though not the money.” He
used this phrase as a sort of chant.</p>

<p>“Quarry,” said Emma sternly,
“sober up, and think true for a
minute!”</p>

<p>But he interrupted to say: “Sober
up? Emma, you’re enough to
turn a saint. I am so sober that
the boys laugh at me the way they
done at Jarlsen, and I’ve done the
wonderfullest thing! Money’ll be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>so loose you can pick it up off anything
in such a little while! I invested
yours in a great concern;
it’s safe. I’m at the head of it!”
He finished, with some tardy regard
for truth, and, waving his arms
comprehensively, lapsed again into
vagueness.</p>

<p>“Where did you put it?” Emma
uttered her queries with pains, as if
she put them to a foreigner.</p>

<p>Then came lavish excuse. “I
put it in an investment,” said he.
He was a little sobered now, and
wore a scared look. “Mr. Jarlsen,
’fore he was took with the blast, got
me to promise to invest his money.
He had a pulmonition of the blast,
so he did.”</p>

<p>Emma looked at him again; her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>face was white and hopeless, and
its young modelling seemed aged
and heavy.</p>

<p>“You ain’t gone and sunk that
altogether, Quarry, hev you? If
you hev, there’s only the Stonepastures
left. It’ll be a hard thing to
pass the Bridge once for all and see
your work-fellers comin’ through
on the cars, and you only comin’ es
fur es the Pastures from the factory.
Can’t you think what you done
with it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve spent it. It’s invested&mdash;but
still&mdash;it’s spent.”</p>

<p>She saw that the men would
have to take the matter up for
her. At first anger had nerved
her, but now she felt weakly despairing.
It seemed to her that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>there was no use in effort to set
right circumstances so awry, until,
as she said, “things had stopped
happening.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a thief, anyway,”
she said, “and I’d fight you if I
had any pith in me!”</p>

<p>Quarry raised himself. “That’s
you all over,” he remarked sadly.
“I’ve seen you leap on Jarlsen
quick as a wicked cat; and a lady
as lifts a hand to a half-dead man
is no lady. You have made my
life very profane, Emma. I don’t
find in you the flavour of a godly
woman, Emma Butte,” he added
with a final effort at dignity.
“You’re a&mdash;a&mdash;mean girl!”</p>

<p>Emma rose, and, standing, looked
him over thoroughly. No idea of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>law came to aid her ignorant helplessness.
She understood now the
saying that women were “put
upon.” Some girls would have
cried, but Emma had one sweet
drop in the bitter draught. She
would have to move to the Stonepastures,
but by so doing she could
pay the doctor, even though she
had to shave again.</p>

<span class="smaller">BREAKING UP A HOME.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“It is better to live under God’s sky than under
a roof when there’s no luck there.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> and I, knowing the use of
pen, ink, and paper, and the efficacy
of latter-day postal systems, must
remember that there are degrees of
education; also, that all the methods
of communication in well organized
communities are as unknown
to the ignorant, Americo-alien
population of such places as
Soot City as is the fate of nations to
the speculative schoolboy. Emma
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>needed Black’s counsel, but she did
not think of the post as a means
of getting a letter to a man in her
own town. She reasoned that post-office
people would slight mail matter
not destined to go by train to
other cities. So her anxious heart
kept her waking to catch the light,
that she might get away in secret
to Black’s house and there put her
case in his ever-open and ever-busy
hands.</p>

<p>Youthful weariness demands
sleep. Emma was young and
overweary, and, as a consequence,
overslept.</p>

<p>It was in the fear that calamity
might have stolen another march
on her that she dressed herself. She
had about her a neatness that enraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the down-at-heel disheartened,
of which there are so many
in labouring communities.</p>

<p>“The world,” she thought, “has
thumped me till I ain’t got half
the spring I hed to start on; and
that’s the reason I’m goin’ to dress
up. I’ll wear cuffs till I’ve got to
sell ’em, and a collar, ef I do have
to shave for a livin’.”</p>

<p>But she had not enough pleasure
in living left to heat the coffee that
her father had used at his breakfast;
she was only thankful that he had
gone away for his paper By the
Bridge, and that she might set
about vacating the house, with a
will. She did not think of consulting
him. When a man has consented
all his life to anything and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>never met any circumstance, crucial
or casual, with aught but irrelevant
comment, he is rarely a factor in
other people’s plans.</p>

<p>She was glad she had not had to
get breakfast, for she had to tend
Jarlsen. The day was wet, and his
hurts seemed the sorer for the
damp. When she had done all for
him she laid her hand on his, but
the dread of packing her wedding
things was making war on her energies.
She felt she could not rest
till she had packed the white gown
out of sight and mind. Before
now she had held a private service
of tears over her six wedding presents.
Miss Bentley had given her
a jacket edged with good fur, and
her sister had given her some fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>stockings; but her lover’s gift
meant more to her than any other
inanimate thing. It certainly meant
more than bread, for she would have
starved before she sold it, and died
in happiness had her eyes but met
it as they closed finally.</p>

<p>It was a large locket of reddish
gold, embossed in clumsy arabesque;
within were two photographs&mdash;of
Jarlsen and of Cheyne
Falls, where they were to have
spent their wedding week. It was
the fashionable tribute from groom
to bride in Jarlsen’s circle of Soot
citizens, and Emma felt that with
this gift he conferred his higher
class on her. It was just what he
would have given the first foreman’s
daughter. She opened the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>locket and looked in. Eve may
have felt like her and Emma
thought of her; it was an angel
with a fiery sword who put them
both out of God’s Eden, she remembered.
But some of Eve’s
memories must have been self-reproachful,
and Emma was spared
that misery. She was also a fine
enough type to appreciate that.</p>

<p>She was shutting up her little
shrine when Jerry Black found her.
They met with tears that had not
started at their meeting; for Jerry
had wept at having to return in
sorrow to the house where but
yesterday hope had hurried him.</p>

<p>To begin a new series of troubles
just as he had completed an old one
told on his nerves. He had spent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>the long night praying for Emma,
his head on his shiny rosewood dining
table.</p>

<p>He always showed this table with
pride; it was made from the extra
wood he had been commissioned to
buy for the Bentley coffins. He
had made it himself, and time and
again had shown it to Miss Bentley,
in whom he felt a great disappointment,
as she never manifested
any satisfaction at the sight. The
cats leaped upon it nightly, as it
was Jerry’s habitual place of prayer,
and it sometimes seemed to him
that they exchanged glances with
each other in his despite, glances of
criticism at his fervour. He never
drove them away, however.</p>

<p>“Emma,” he said, his lips trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and his pale eyes filling fast,
“your trouble’s fearful heavy, but
you won’t give in. I’ve seen to
Quarry, and it jest ain’t no use; you
can’t get anything out of him; he
give it all in to the Workers’ Protective
Circle. He give it in to the
aggression fund. They’re going to
order a strike for the same pay for
winter days nine hours’ work, as
they get for a ten-hours’ summer’s
day. I think that’s it. My work’s
among the peaceful, and sometimes
I thank God I hev it mostly
among dead men, seein’ what the
live ones is like. But, Emma, he’s
give the money in, so’s the strike
fund can grow. He’s a gainin’,
winnin’ kind of speaker, and he’s
give up what he took to their cause,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>and no one ain’t a-goin’ to touch
him. Now you jest remember that
the night’s blackest just before the
sun comes, and don’t you loose
your grip. When Jarlsen comes
out from the blast you want him to
find you jest es straight and steady
es when he was took&mdash;don’t you
now?”</p>

<p>The tears slipped from Emma’s
eyes at the little man’s tone. Her
face was as tranquil as it was sorrowing,
and, as she answered, there
was no bitterness in her voice and
no fretfulness or rebellion in gesture
or look. She did not feel
bound to exhibit spirit in his presence.
“O Jerry,” she said, “I think
I do. But I can’t stay fit for him
when I live with thieves who rob
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>him. I’m glad he got the blast ef
I have to get low-toned; he’ll be
nearer a mate for me.”</p>

<p>Jerry stayed on and helped her.
He packed away the white dress;
he was used to handling things that
were sacred to the memory of a
happy past, and began to pull
Emma’s house to pieces as only a
woman could be expected to do.
Martha Long came in; she was
sewing as she walked. She was a
brisk woman, and got through half
her work on the wing.</p>

<p>“God’s name!” she said to Black,
“what’s come to Emma? She
looks hurt, and white as a death-sheet.”</p>

<p>Jerry told her what had happened,
and Martha, without a word,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>went over and took both the girl’s
hands in hers and pressed them to
her sides; she never lost hold of
her sewing, and presently set to
work again.</p>

<p>“Well,” she half screamed in indignation,
“of all the poison toads
and irregular vipers in the world
and out of it, I guess Quarry’s the
lowest down. He’s a dirt-mean
man! I suppose you’ll move out,
and take the yeller house on the
Pastures. There ain’t no one in it
since last May, and it has a porch.
You won’t stay there long,” Martha
said with conviction. “Your kind
don’t keep to no rent-free Stonepastures.
You’ll come back to the
town, and the crowd’ll cheer you&mdash;you’ll
see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” Emma replied, “I’m going
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, at five, or a little
later, Jerry brought a funeral carriage
By the Bridge, and old Butte
and Emma and Jerry and Martha
carried Jarlsen on a shake-down
along the Tracks. The sun, as Jerry
observed, was “leanin’ pretty near
the west line,” and the sky was
bright above the Stonepastures. It
had cleared in the early afternoon,
and all the odours, bad and good,
seemed flying about, riding on the
cool breezes that swept over the
Tracks. The high-standing ripe
grasses caught the level shafts of
sun and bowed before the wind,
glorified in the bright light. Jarlsen
questioned them about his removal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
but gave no evidence that
he heard their replies except once,
when he said that Emma “sounded”
tired. But his voice died
away in groanings, and he could
not answer their other questions.
Emma felt that he heard her
voice and did not distinguish the
words.</p>

<p>Jerry felt so too. He reminded
Emma of the blind man in the
Testament. “He seen the men
first as trees,” he said, “even when
he was cured with grace, and not
with herbs and ointment and such;
he didn’t get clear vision right
away.”</p>

<p>Emma felt happier than she had
thought possible. She ran back
into the yard and slipped off her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>shoe. “I’ll get the favour of home
for him,” she thought.</p>

<p>But while the handful of mould
was still in her hand she put her
shoe on again. “I’d liefer shake
off the dust from my feet,” she
said; “this ain’t no home to get
the favour from.”</p>

<p>Martha Long stood at the gate,
“You’re in a hurry to go,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“To-morrow begins the new
month’s rent,” said Emma. “I quit
to-day or pay to-morrow. I’m goin’
where there ain’t no rents to pay. I
can’t afford rents and city doctors
together.”</p>

<p>Martha’s face darkened. “I’m
layin’ for him right here,” she called
as the funeral carriage moved away.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>She was surprised at Emma’s good-bye
mood; it was so resolute and
cheerful. “He’s a pretty low reptile,”
was the last thing she called
to Emma as the conveyance grew
smaller on the distant road.</p>

HOSTESS.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“Strife’s a poor thing to come home to.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> two days’ time Emma was
“settled in.” Hers was an odd
house for the Stonepastures. She
paid no rent for it, but there were
curtains at the windows and a shoe-scraper
and a mat at the door. She
had not been up an hour on her first
morning before the grass around the
house was cut down with a borrowed
sickle. The objectless, listless
denizens of the district watched her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>with some pleasure. They had no
individual life, merely existing as a
class and watching the individuality
of others take shape in thrift and
then in prosperity with a dull envy.
One man said she “hed a peck of
ambition” in a tone that meant on
the Pastures, in “Calamity Row,”
that any endeavour to better one’s
self comes to confusion.</p>

<p>At first the big boulders depressed
her somewhat, but Jerry
told her she could “garden on them”
in the summer time; and, indeed,
flowers could grow from the thin
soil that edged them. For two
weeks and more she lived, quietly
amazed to find herself so happy.
From day to day she watched the
Swede’s improvement. As the pain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>left him he took to singing, but his
voice was not so accurate as in the
old days when he heard clearly.
Many of the songs she had heard
from him in courting time, and she
was infinitely happy to know that
he remembered them as well as she
did. He would tell the meaning of
each verse after he had sung it, as
she cooked or sewed after shaving
all day.</p>

<p>For she shaved again. It seemed
very odd and yet very natural to
her. She had a good deal of business
to arrange before “resuming
trade.” Her subscriptions to the
Philadelphia Ledger and the Work-fellows’
Union had run out; in fact,
her wedding day had been dependent
on their expiration. Emma
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>had a great idea of doing things the
right way, and news has been the
tradition of barber-shops since men’s
vanity first devised a shorn chin.</p>

<p>Emma was gratified to find her
standing unimpaired by her sojourn
with the paupers. Socially she
seemed secure. The women were
prone to be officiously sympathetic,
and were also inclined to disbelieve
the tale of Quarry’s misdeed.
“There’s faults on both sides, maybe,”
and “Who can see the whole
show through a slit in the tent?”
were felt to be convenient phrases
and used largely as such. The
phrase “rent-free” found its way
from the neighbours’ lips to Emma’s
ears rather oftener than she
cared for; it spurred her on to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>grudge herself food and deny herself
the midday beer it had been
her wont to consume. She worked
from eight in the morning to six at
night, with nothing but bread and
soup at her slack time in the early
afternoon.</p>

<p>The soup was much like Quarry’s
stories&mdash;made up out of almost
nothing. She carried it to work in
a bottle with a screwed-on tin top;
this she put into the little boiler
that the shaving water was heated
in, “and so,” she would say, to
amuse a new customer, “thet’s all
the cooking I hev to do; I boil
my bottle, and there I am!”</p>

<p>She had rented a room By the
Bridge from Miss Bentley, who was
much surprised when Emma paid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>the rent; and through her new and
improved business situation in the
town she was able to command a
“high-class custom.”</p>

<p>Since the evening that Quarry
had suggested the depot as a place
of residence Emma had been free of
his presence. She had heard of him
from the men, however, and knew
that he was speaking to them from
the Bridge every evening. Revolt
was in the air of Soot City; there
were meetings, quite covertly, conducted
by socialistic workmen in
the cause of workfellows’ profits.
Monopoly and co-operative profit
were talked of constantly, and
Grigg sold many drinks. It is a
pity that the workingmen who invent
Utopias should attempt to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>sanctify them with an alcoholic immersion.
It antagonizes even the
fair-minded. The preachers took to
finding comparisons, more or less
apposite, between Dives and Lazarus,
pronouncing the socialism of
him who has not, grabbing from
him who has, to be merely a modern
variation of a scriptural scheme
of all things in common. As some
men go to church to find biblical
sanction for their shortcomings;
the ringleaders of what was fast becoming
an agitation, took to the
sanctuaries, whither the rest of the
town felt it safe to follow them.</p>

<p>Emma regarded Quarry’s effrontery
as monumental, but she never
conceived a possibility of his coming
to her new house in the Stonepastures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
She felt that, as she had
gone down in the world, he thought
he had risen, and that the Stonepastures
were very far away from
him now. Her eyes would scan the
road, in her swift evening walks
searching for his slightly crooked
form. The thought of him distressed
her, as horror comes upon a
child in the dark, and after nightfall
she remembered him as such a
power for evil. Returning from the
town she always wore for warmth
her leathern apron with a shawl,
her jacket was too good to be
worn out in the dark. This scruple
was pure conscience, for she no
longer had Jarlsen’s eye for which
to save her dresses.</p>

<p>He could tell the difference in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>footfalls now, and distinguish voices.
Emma longed for the moment when
he should be able to hear her speak
his name. This hoped-for moment
occupied many of her hours, and
she thought of it on the still, cold
night when she saw Quarry walking
toward the Pastures about ten
yards ahead of her. She slackened
her pace instantly, and he was soon
lost in the starless dark.</p>

<p>She dreaded him. As she walked
she feared she might stumble on
him lying drunk in her path, with
his mouth full of the hideous words
he used at such times; or, this fear
forgotten, her breath would come
in loud pantings at the thought of
his hands laid on her from behind.
When she came to her own door
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>there was still no sight of him; she
looked both up and down the road
to make sure. She could not see
far, for most of the houses were
dark; lights are too expensive for
the rent-free Pastures. Raising the
latch, she pushed the door quietly
open and looked into her own
home.</p>

<p>Quarry was at the kitchen table
facing her, glaring in Jarlsen’s serenely
blind countenance. Sleep
had double-locked the Swede’s
seared vision, and in complete unconsciousness
he breathed freely,
within a glance of Quarry’s eyes
alive with malice.</p>

<p>Emma was frightened, so much
so that she could not call. It
seemed that Quarry must have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>something to kill with, in his
coarse, cramped hands. It flashed
across her that if she received him
roughly he would strike or stab,
and that an appearance of politeness
would surely gain her time.
Calmness came to her when she
had determined how to act.</p>

<p>She rattled the latch, her heart
jumping so that she felt as if it had
thrown her into the room. Quarry
let fall something that gave out the
sound of thin metal as it struck the
brick flooring round the stove. A
flight of chills froze her blood, while
her cheeks burned with a steady,
excited glow.</p>

<p>Quarry could not avoid her eyes
and she saw that were he to have
the first word he would announce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>himself at bay and make trouble.
She almost ran to him with her
hand stretched out. “Quarry,” said
she in a little voice that she strained
to make audible, “Quarry, you’ll
have a bite, won’t you? It’s a cold
bite, but a ready one.”</p>

<p>Emma thought later that it was
at the sound of Quarry’s name in
her voice that Jarlsen wakened.
He knew at once that Quarry was
there, for a look that had been absent
from his face since they moved
from By the Tracks swept its strong
patience and sweetness away. He
stood on his feet and reached out
for the Englishman. The bandages
on his right hand seemed too tight,
and the veins in it bursting.</p>

<p>“I’m not dead yet!” he said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>fiercely, “and no thanks to
you!”</p>

<p>Emma could have cried for joy.
To her it seemed more than likely
that he saw again; but when she
noticed how easily Quarry had
eluded his big rival, the situation
was obscured.</p>

<p>“Did I hurt him?” called Jarlsen
eagerly. He had fallen back on his
chair, but was sitting on its edge,
his eyes burning, and the blood reddening
the fine skin on his forehead.</p>

<p>She did not answer, having
learned not to waste words on his
deafness. She saw Quarry stoop
down and lift up the knife he had
let fall.</p>

<p>Then she spoke, and very gently.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>“You’d better stay here, Quarry,”
she said; “you’re accustomed to
your home here, and there’s most
sleep in an old nest.”</p>

<p>And he stayed. Emma turned
him in with old Butte, and lighted
a new candle, which she left to
illumine the rats through the night.
Then she locked Jarlsen’s door on
the outside, and tied the key around
her neck. She reflected with pride
that her Swede had only been sitting
up for two days, and yet wanted
to fight on the evening of the second.
In her joy at his returning
strength she lost sight of danger.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">“Having ears to hear, let them hear.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sleep of young strength puts
a wide distance between yesterday’s
cares and to-day’s. The dawn that
awoke Emma was gray, but it did
not suggest the blight of ashes as
had last night’s twilight. She was
sure of the return of Jarlsen’s faculties,
and she also knew that Quarry
could have made no disturbance
through the night. She was inclined
to think that he meant to
frighten them, and by daylight his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>acts seemed more like very bad
manners than like an attempt at
murder.</p>

<p>In the morning, before setting
out, she changed the bandage on
Jarlsen’s hand. The wide burns
were “guttering,” seaming up in
red lines. She told him this, and
though he made no reply she felt
sure, with unshakable, feminine
sureness, that he had heard. She
led him out to his hammock and
placed him in it. Quarry was haranguing
Old Butte, and the sound
of his voice seemed to make the
Swede nervous. Emma was certain
that he had heard him.</p>

<p>She had always liked the Pastures
as a place to walk; the air was less
flat than in the town; and it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>pleasant to set one’s face against
poverty and one’s feet toward a
place where people were rich
enough to pay rent. Bentley’s
Place overtopped the city on an
artificial and costly eminence. The
little house that was placed like a
lodge was the terminal station of
the narrow-gauge railway. She
knew herself to be two miles and
three quarters from that, and a mile
or more from the plant.</p>

<p>Usually she met the day squad
coming out from the town, the
men standing in the ore cars, the
smoke from their pipes and the
straining, overworked little engine
blown behind them toward the
town&mdash;like a message sent home,
Emma thought. But to-day no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>cars passed, and she, being a child
of toil, was quick to know that this
meant a strike. She hurried on
to her earnings, remembering that
when men are out of work they
have all day in which to spend
their savings. Women see so little
in strikes but higher wages until
some one is dead.</p>

<p>When she reached the Bridge it
was crowded with people. Men
who had not worked at the plant
for years were exhorting their fellows
not to submit to tyranny.
Many large words were being misused
with great pride by those who
never had a chance to talk except
when the crowd was too busy to
listen. The women were not very
carefully dressed, having had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>time for fastenings or strings.
They, together with the children
they brought with them, seemed to
regard the occasion as one of festivity.</p>

<p>Nothing was denounced very
definitely. One stranger was said
to be a reporter, whereupon half a
dozen people beset him, anxious
to have their views in the paper.
Emma could learn nothing from
any of them. They used Quarry’s
and Bowa’s names frequently, so
that she forebore mentioning under
whose roof the Englishman had
passed the night.</p>

<p>Her shop was in the fourth
house from the Bridge; a steep
diagonal path ran from its back
door to the Tracks. The men were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>swarming to it before she was quite
ready to have them, and many arrived
by the rarely used footway.
News came with them, and she
found herself believing first one report
and then another. Bowa came
to be shaved; she was surprised at
his thinking of a thing so incidental
to a holiday toilet as a shave, but
she supposed that he was resolved
to die tidy, and said as much.</p>

<p>He could not be at the plant, he
explained, and felt that he had no
need to be there. His smile was
exceedingly subtle, but his hands
worked against his will in an embarrassed
fashion.</p>

<p>The day wore on until about four
o’clock. Her business had been immense,
and she had listened to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>many accounts and descriptions of
the plant until she felt she knew it
perfectly. In the centre was the
powder house, where explosives
were kept; on the city flank was
the nutt and bolt factory, and very
near, but south of it, the furnace.
It was set on a steep “slide” of
rock; its door, through which the
furnace was fed, was on the summit
side; and on the base side, lower
on the slide by eight feet or more,
was another door through which
the “cinder” flew away at night into
the darkness like a burning river.
This door seems complicated on
paper, though in fact its construction
is simple. A skewer secures
it at its upper edge&mdash;a skewer with
a large loop at one end. Into this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>loop the hook of the fire-tenders’
strange implement is thrust when
the door is to be opened. “The
Devil’s Crook” is what the men
have named the long oak stick
finished at one end with an iron
hook. It does look like a thing
wherewith to herd black sheep.</p>

<p>Emma was weary of constant exclamation
and argument. It was
time she ate; so she closed her
door and “boiled her bottle,” allowing
the men who were already in
the shop to remain there. She saw
Bowa get up from his chair and
leave by the back door, silent and
hurried. As was natural, Emma
turned to the window to see what
had caught his eye in the street.</p>

<p>Young Bentley had driven up in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>his buggy; his liveried servant sat
beside him, and the horse he drove
plunged and shook with nervousness
at being surrounded by a
crowd of loud-voiced people. Bentley
stood up in the little buggy,
having given the reins to his man.
“See here,” he said, addressing the
crowd, “if we have a strike, you’d
better remember that I can stand
it, and you can’t. I’ve sent police
to the plant to protect my property,
and you had better stand by
them; for the plant is the machine
you make your bread with, and it’s
the only thing you can work at.
I’ve got lots of irons on the fire.
Now some one has trifled with
this road-bed, in the cut here, By
the Bridge. I suppose you want
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>to make me lose my charter. I’m
going to examine the damage now,
and I hope you’ll come with me.”</p>

<p>He jumped to the ground and
began to descend the steps leading
to the road-bed in the cut, over
which the Bridge is. No one followed
him, but with admirable
nerve he neither hesitated nor
quickened his pace.</p>

<p>Emma remembered that Jarlsen
had liked him, and that he had
called to ask for him once By the
Tracks and twice on the Pastures.
No Bentley had visited the Pastures
before, and Emma felt the
distinction keenly. She opened the
door and went out, merely observing
to the bystanders that they
“hed no spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Before she got to the stair’s head
about six men had followed her,
looking deeply ashamed of each
other, but at present firm in their
duty. Emma let them pass her,
and slipped into the advancing
crowd.</p>

<p>Bowa and three companions were
standing on the tracks by two overturned
ore cars. They seemed more
sheepish than defiant, and Emma
noticed with pride how neat Bowa
looked as he tried not to flinch
under Bentley’s contemptuous gaze.
The rails were torn up for about
twenty yards, and in the silence
that preceded Bentley’s first words
Emma realized that this meant
prison.</p>

<p>“Did you do that?” he said at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>length. Then turning to the men
at his back, he said very pleasantly,
“I think we can put this right
with”&mdash;his voice grew suddenly
louder&mdash;“two more to help us.”</p>

<p>Two Soot City police appeared,
and very quietly secured Bowa and
his friends. They were too surprised
to make any resistance, and
went silent and sullen at Bentley’s
curt bidding. Some one cried,
“Shame!” at the plant owner.
Martha Long answered “Nonsense!”
very loud. But her tears
fell for Bowa, and she pleaded for
him in words.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bentley,” she said, “he was
put up to that. He’s young for the
shadder of a prison to fall on him.
He’s as mild as new milk, and he’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>had his taste, and he won’t want no
more.”</p>

<p>“Martha,” Bentley answered, “I
think making an example of a
workman is making a martyr of
him and an enemy of his labour
organization. I don’t want any
strikes, so I’ll probably let him off;
but I wouldn’t promise any one.”</p>

<p>Martha went away well comforted,
and Emma, when the darkness
had fallen, set out for home.
She considered the strike was over,
and laughed as she made herself
pictures of Quarry’s discomfiture;
his plans would be henceforth unheeded,
and, as he had not succeeded,
the men would not fear
him, and not fearing meant, under
such conditions, shunning. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>had had a diverting day; the silver
jingled in her pocket, and her wish
was that Jarlsen might have ears
to hear all about it.</p>

<p>The cottage was dark, but before
she came within a hundred yards of
it, while it yet stood out black and
square against the dark east, she
heard Jarlsen calling, “Emma, hurry,
girl!&mdash;Emma, girl, hurry!”</p>

<p>She ran to him, stumbling and
in dread, and groped in the darkness
of the room with tender hands
that feared&mdash;she longed to know
just what.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he said; “but
listen. Speak to me; I can hear.
I’ve heard ever since we moved.
I’ve wanted to say so, but I wanted
to go on hearing your father talk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>to Quarry. I’ve heard it all. I’m
done with secrets; I’m pretty near
done with theirs. Speak to me,
Emma; I can prove it.”</p>

<p>“I’m so bursting-out happy, I
can’t talk much,” said she.</p>

<p>Her speech followed her in his
voice. “I’m so bursting-out happy,
I can’t talk much.’ But I can hear!
Emma, Quarry and your poppa
have been setting it up since we
came here, and I was afraid to say
I heard, for fear two couldn’t keep
a secret. Emma, we want the
plant’s pension, and we’re going to
get it!</p>

<p>“You’re going now,” he said, “to
run out to the plant&mdash;to run your
best; when you get there, go to the
furnace. If you keep right on By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>the Tracks, nobody’ll mind you.
Quarry’s bought the furnace-minders,
and they’re going to leave for
the station to report a disturbance
in the factory. The Devil’s Crook
is in the little house by the furnace;
it is by the door. You take
it as you pass&mdash;no one’ll be there&mdash;and
when you see a light in the
factory you open the centre door
and make a flare, for the police
can’t see in the dark. You’ll catch
’em; O Emma, hurry! I’ve got a
good chance to fix Quarry, and he
didn’t warn me of that blast, or I
wouldn’t be here now. He put his
flag behind his back when he saw
me come, and I walked right on.
Hurry, Emma girl! Don’t burn
yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Emma could feel that he wanted
to go himself. She caught up her
shawl. “Is it the powder house?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake,” he said loudly,
“get started! Of course it is!”</p>

<p>She ran out into the wide darkness.
She was racing death, and
she knew it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EYE OF GOD.</span></h2></div>

<p class="center no-indent">“And the eye of God shall pierce the
lengthy darkness.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma’s</span> first thought was of the
time that it would take her to get
to the plant. Young Bentley had
once run a mile under five minutes,
and his feat had been in the
newspapers; but she could not, of
course, count on herself for like
speed. She felt that the cinder
flare would light up her life’s crisis.
Jarlsen’s excited voice echoed in
her mind, and the thought that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>Quarry might have saved him with
the warning flag, instead of letting
him come unchecked on live powder,
urged her on the faster. She
saw that to-day’s attempt at the
Tracks was a forced incident, intended
to look like the strike’s
crisis. She remembered her own
part in it with laughter.</p>

<p>She was choked with anxiety.
It seemed to her that if the powder
house were fired there would
be no food anywhere in Soot City.
Who would be killed and how
much would be damaged was an
unanswerable question that weakened
her with painful suspense.
She barely noticed the hissing rush
of her breath or felt the pain in her
side. Her feet grew heavy, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>noise of their fall on the road-bed
sounded to her as if it was far off
in the town. Her neck was craned
in the direction of the plant, and
she wanted to throw herself along
the earth. When the lights at the
sidings and at the station grew
nearer her dimmed eyes could barely
distinguish them. Some warm
thing, with a new taste, crept over
her lips. She put up her hand to
it, and saw in the light at the first
siding that it was blood.</p>

<p>Her body rocked with the push
of her heart-beats, and “yet,” she
thought, “I may be late.”</p>

<p>At last she passed the station.
Through its blindless windows she
could see Benz, the furnace-tender,
talking fast to the police. For a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>moment she thought of going in
and telling her story, but she feared
a loss of time, and started furiously
up the grade to the tool-house. She
found the door standing open and
entered boldly, snatching the crook
and striking at a man who raised
himself from the floor. He lay
down again at once, saying, “All
right, only don’t tell me where you
put it.”</p>

<p>“I’m in time,” she thought.</p>

<p>There was a little patch of light
before the threshold. Looking up,
she saw four policemen crossing by
the powder house to the factory.
Then the scheme came entire into
her puzzled brain. They were
called out on search and it was
their lights in the factory that were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>to be taken as the signal for Quarry’s
men to fire the mine. The
furnace-tenders had gone as guides,
and the unshifted cinder could not
expose offenders.</p>

<p>“He’s a cute viper!” Emma was
talking to herself to keep her nerve;
she was spent and breathless.</p>

<p>The heat by the furnace was terrible;
it shone on the iron trough
in an outlined square of yellow,
where the light streamed through
the door cracks. She fitted the
crook’s hook to the loop of the
skewer and paused, waiting. Her
thoughts were busy with the way
in which they might fire the powder
stores. Heat and cold hurried
through her alternately; her hands
and brow were wet. There were,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>of course, no men on duty at the
plant save forty of the factory force,
Quarry among them. Emma saw
that this was part of the blind.</p>

<p>The electric lights were out;
they had not been turned on since
early the last evening, but presently
one shone from the ground floor of
the factory. Emma pulled back her
crook exultingly, but the skewer
would not give. She jerked, but it
was firm. Gathering her strength,
she braced her feet and threw herself
back. She saw a fiery line pass
above her head, and heard the red-hot
skewer tinkle against a stone
behind her. She rushed to the front
of the furnace to get rid of the heat,
and stood on the crest of the incline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>As the cinder flew in a glowing
mass down the trough to the cinder
hill, she saw the spires at the city
and the Bridge. Then she looked
directly before her.</p>

<p>As the night lifted from the
plant yard she saw that some one
was running; the figure took on it
the red of the brightening furnace
waste, and the flame of the torch
the runner carried grew white in
the rosy glare. The light spread
higher, and Emma saw the tops of
the elm trees that grew on the
other side of the factory. The cinder
rattled in the trough with a
grating loudness.</p>

<p>“He hes a train of oiled rope
laid,” said she.</p>

<p>The plant-hand was Quarry, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>still he ran toward the powder
house in the vivid light. The men,
most of them police, were watching
him. He knelt with his light in
his hand, and fell forward, the torch
under him. Then Emma heard a
pistol shot that sounded like snapping
fingers in the din of the cinder
waste.</p>

<p>Bentley’s voice was hardly heard
in the various noise that followed
the shot. “Lock up God’s eye!”
he called; “it’s done big work, but
don’t waste fuel.”</p>

<p>And a woman’s voice, peevish
from fatigue, called from the height:
“I can’t&mdash;I’m broken, I’m so tired!”</p>

<p>But Quarry did not stir; his
torch was out. And in the house
on the Pastures Jarlsen’s eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>strained themselves to pierce their
own darkness, although the cloudy
sky was like a red sea, and the plant
stood out plainly with orange elm
trees and bright roofs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EPILOGUE">EPILOGUE.</h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were disputing in the train
as to whether it was five or six
years since Quarry’s death. I said
six, and was told that I was always
wrong. My adversary evidently
considered this second-rate rejoinder
a retort. Presently he said,
“You may be right, for I think
Jarlsen’s boy is five.”</p>

<p>Jerry Black met us at the station;
he wore a bailiff’s uniform
of corduroy. The Bentleys were
very English now, but kinder than
ever. We got into an omnibus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>and asked Jerry to come too. He
had to be urged, for he is still
modest.</p>

<p>“How are the Stonepastures?”
said I, anxious to start the conversation.</p>

<p>“Lean livin’ yet,” he answered,
sighing; “but we’ve got a home for
the aged indigent, and a hospital.”</p>

<p>He began to talk in earnest, and,
among other things, told us that
Emma paid the doctor the week
after Quarry died. He said she
felt as if she had killed Quarry, but
that her marriage had put it out
of her head. “The Jarlsens are
getting on fine,” he remarked confidentially,
“more than happy in
their fortunes. August has sold
his idea for freight couplers to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>plant, and he’s living in the back
of the new schoolhouse, and he
goes away singing and gets paid
for it. He bought a piano with
his savings.”</p>

<p>“Emma’s too fine to shave me,
I suppose,” said I.</p>

<p>“Don’t name it to her, please,”
implored Jerry.</p>

<p>We arrived at the church&mdash;it was
Bentley’s wedding we were attending&mdash;and
on either side of the walk
through the yard the men and
women of the plant waited for the
bride. There was not a foot of
space left in the church. Bowa
stood next me, and with him was
Martha Long. “It’s a pleasanter
time than the last,” she said as I
greeted her. We had been staying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>at the plant in the strike when
Quarry had gone under, and I was
pleased that she remembered it.
Black was everywhere. At last he
pushed us all back to clear the path
for the bride. Bentley was in the
church at the chancel.</p>

<p>Then there broke on our eager
ears the finest tenor I had ever
heard. They say he sang a Swedish
wedding song. I don’t care
what it was&mdash;I almost cried when
he stopped. His voice rose high
and strong, and seemed to spread
like perfume; he sang gladly.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>Every one within hearing answered
proudly, “Jarlsen.”</p>

‘The Deemster’ is a story of unusual power.... Certain passages and
chapters have an intensely dramatic grasp, and hold the fascinated reader
with a force rarely excited nowadays in literature.”&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p>“One of the strongest novels which has appeared in many a day.”&mdash;<i>San
Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE BONDMAN.</i> New edition. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>“The welcome given to this story has cheered and touched me, but
I am conscious that, to win a reception so warm, such a book must have
had readers who brought to it as much as they took away.... I have
called my story a saga, merely because it follows the epic method, and I
must not claim for it at any point the weighty responsibility of history, or
serious obligations to the world of fact. But it matters not to me what
Icelanders may call ‘The Bondman,’ if they will honor me by reading it in
the open-hearted spirit and with the free mind with which they are content
to read of Grettir and of his fights with the Troll.”&mdash;<i>From the Author’s
Preface.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">C</span>APT’N DAVY’S HONEYMOON. A Manx Yarn.</i>
12mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p>“A new departure by this author. Unlike his previous works, this little
tale is almost wholly humorous, with, however, a current of pathos underneath.
It is not always that an author can succeed equally well in tragedy
and in comedy, but it looks as though Mr. Hall Caine would be one of the
exceptions.”&mdash;<i>London Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“It is pleasant to meet the author of ‘The Deemster’ in a brightly humorous
little story like this.... It shows the same observation of Manx
character, and much of the same artistic skill.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE STARK MUNRO LETTERS.</i> Being a Series
of Twelve Letters written by <span class="smcap">J. Stark Munro</span>, M. B.,
to his friend and former fellow-student, Herbert Swanborough,
of Lowell, Massachusetts, during the years 1881-1884.
Illustrated. 12mo. Buckram, $1.50.</p>

<p>This original and dramatic story presents fresh types, extraordinary
situations, and novel suggestions with a freshness and
vigor which show that the romancer’s heart was in his work. How
far certain incidents of the story are based upon personal experiences
it is impossible to say, but the unflagging interest and unexpected
phases of the romance are no less in evidence than the
close personal relations established between author and reader.
In the “Stark Munro Letters” the author has achieved another
success which will add to the number of his American friends and
readers.</p>

<p>“Any one who has read any of the fascinating stories in which the
shrewd detective, Sherlock Holmes, figures as the very personification of
detective logic applied to the detection of crime, knows that Conan Doyle
is a story-teller of the very first order of merit. Like his own character,
Sherlock Holmes, he possesses the power of getting out of everything all
there is in it.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Item.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Doyle’s stories are so well known for their strong dramatic style,
for the elegance of expression, that anything new from his pen is sure to be
warmly welcomed. His readers are sure of getting a literary treat from
anything he writes. He is broad-minded and liberal, and the man who
could write two such books as ‘The White Company’ and ‘The Refugees’
has a future which the shades of Scott and Dickens might envy.”&mdash;<i>Albany
Times-Union.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">R</span>OUND THE RED LAMP.</i> 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.
<i>Seventh edition.</i></p>

<p>The “Red Lamp,” the trade-mark, as it were, of the English
country practitioner’s office, is the central point of these dramatic
stories of professional life. There are no secrets for the surgeon,
and, a surgeon himself as well as a novelist, the author has made
a most artistic use of the motives and springs of action revealed
to him in a field of which he is the master.</p>

<p>“Too much can not be said in praise of these strong productions, that,
to read, keep one’s heart leaping to the throat and the mind in a tumult of
anticipation to the end.... No series of short stories in modern literature
can approach them.”&mdash;<i>Hartford Times.</i></p>

<p>“The reading of these choice stories will prove an exciting pleasure to
all who may linger on the pages that present them.”&mdash;<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

<p>“A strikingly realistic and decidedly original contribution to modern
literature.”&mdash;<i>Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

With a Biographical Sketch, and numerous
Illustrations by Maurice Leloir. 8vo. Cloth, gilt top, uniform
with “Picciola,” “The Story of Colette,” and “An
Attic Philosopher in Paris.” $1.50.</p>

<p>It is believed that this standard edition of “Paul and Virginia” with
Leloir’s charming illustrations will prove a most acceptable addition to the
series of illustrated foreign classics in which D. Appleton &amp; Co. have published
“The Story of Colette,” “An Attic Philosopher in Paris,” and
“Picciola.” No more sympathetic illustrator than Leloir could be found,
and his treatment of this masterpiece of French literature invests it with a
peculiar value.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">P</span>ICCIOLA.</i> By <span class="smcap">X. B. Saintine</span>. With 130 Illustrations
by <span class="smcap">J. F. Gueldry</span>. 8vo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.50.</p>

<p>“Saintine’s ‘Picciola,’ the pathetic tale of the prisoner who raised a
flower between the cracks of the flagging of his dungeon, has passed definitely
into the list of classic books.... It has never been more beautifully
housed than in this edition, with its fine typography, binding, and sympathetic
illustrations.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“A suitable holiday gift for a friend who appreciates refined literature.”&mdash;<i>Boston
Times.</i></p>

<p>“The influence of the book is wholly good. The volume is a particularly
handsome one.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“It is a classic. It has found an appropriate reliquary. Faithfully
translated, charmingly illustrated by Jean Claude with full-page pictures,
vignettes in the text, and head and tail pieces, printed in graceful type on
handsome paper, and bound with an art worthy of Matthews, in half-cloth,
ornamented on the cover, it is an exemplary book, fit to be ‘a treasure for
aye.’”&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE STORY OF COLETTE.</i> A new large-paper
edition. With 36 Illustrations. 8vo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.50.</p>

<p>“One of the handsomest of the books of fiction for the holiday season.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>“One of the gems of the season.... It is the story of the life of young
womanhood in France, dramatically told, with the light and shade and
coloring of the genuine artist, and is utterly free from that which mars too
many French novels. In its literary finish it is well nigh perfect, indicating
the hand of the master.”&mdash;<i>Boston Traveller.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">A</span> FRIEND OF THE QUEEN.</i> (Marie Antoinette&mdash;Count
de Fersen.) By <span class="smcap">Paul Gaulot</span>. With Two Portraits,
12mo. Cloth, $2.00.</p>

<p>“M. Gaulot deserves thanks for presenting the personal history of
Count Fersen in a manner so evidently candid and unbiased.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>“There are some characters in history of whom we never seem to grow
tired. Of no one is this so much the case as of the beautiful Marie Antoinette,
and of that life which is at once so eventful and so tragic.... In
this work we have much that up to the present time has been only vaguely
known.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p>“A historical volume that will be eagerly read.”&mdash;<i>New York Observer.</i></p>

<p>“One of those captivating recitals of the romance of truth which are
the gilding of the pill of history.”&mdash;<i>London Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“It tells with new and authentic details the romantic story of Count
Fersen’s (the Friend of the Queen) devotion to Marie Antoinette, of his
share in the celebrated flight to Varennes, and in many other well known
episodes of the unhappy Queen’s life.”&mdash;<i>London Times.</i></p>

<p>“If the book had no more recommendation than the mere fact that
Marie Antoinette and Count Fersen are rescued at last from the voluminous
and contradictory representations with which the literature of that period
abounds, it would be enough compensation to any reader to become acquainted
with the true delineations of two of the most romantically tragic
personalities.&mdash;”<i>Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE ROMANCE OF AN EMPRESS. Catharine II
of Russia.</i> By <span class="smcap">K. Waliszewski</span>. With Portrait. 12mo.
Cloth, $2.00.</p>

<p>“Of Catharine’s marvelous career we have in this volume a sympathetic,
learned, and picturesque narrative. No royal career, not even of
some of the Roman or papal ones, has better shown us how truth can be
stranger than fiction.”&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>“A striking and able work, deserving of the highest praise.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Ledger.</i></p>

<p>“The book is well called a romance, for although no legends are admitted
in it, and the author has been at pains to present nothing but verified
facts, the actual career of the subject was so abnormal and sensational as to
seem to belong to fiction.”&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>“A dignified, handsome, indeed superb volume, and well worth careful
reading.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Herald.</i></p>

<p>“It is a most wonderful story, charmingly told, with new material to
sustain it, and a breadth and temperance and consideration that go far to
soften one’s estimate of one of the most extraordinary women of history.”&mdash;<i>New
York Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“The perusal of such a book can not fail to add to that breadth of view
which is so essential to the student of universal history.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Bulletin.</i></p>

<p class="no-indent"><i><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY INVENTIONS.</i> By <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span>.
Containing fourteen stories, several of which are now
published for the first time, and two poems, 12mo.
427 pages. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>“The reader turns from its pages with the conviction that the author
has no superior to-day in animated narrative and virility of style. He remains
master of a power in which none of his contemporaries approach him&mdash;the
ability to select out of countless details the few vital ones which create
the finished picture. He knows how, with a phrase or a word, to make
you see his characters as he sees them, to make you feel the full meaning
of a dramatic situation.”&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“‘Many Inventions’ will confirm Mr. Kipling’s reputation.... We
would cite with pleasure sentences from almost every page, and extract
incidents from almost every story. But to what end? Here is the completest
book that Mr. Kipling has yet given us in workmanship, the
weightiest and most humane in breadth of view.”&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Kipling’s powers as a story-teller are evidently not diminishing.
We advise everybody to buy ‘Many Inventions,’ and to profit by some of
the best entertainment that modern fiction has to offer.”&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>“‘Many Inventions’ will be welcomed wherever the English language
is spoken.... Every one of the stories bears the imprint of a master who
conjures up incident as if by magic, and who portrays character, scenery,
and feeling with an ease which is only exceeded by the boldness of force.”&mdash;<i>Boston
Globe.</i></p>

<p>“The book will get and hold the closest attention of the reader.”&mdash;<i>American
Bookseller.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Rudyard Kipling’s place in the world of letters is unique. He
sits quite aloof and alone, the incomparable and inimitable master of the
exquisitely fine art of short-story writing. Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson has
perhaps written several tales which match the run of Mr. Kipling’s work,
but the best of Mr. Kipling’s tales are matchless, and his latest collection,
‘Many Inventions,’ contains several such.”&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p>“Of late essays in fiction the work of Kipling can be compared to
only three&mdash;Blackmore’s ‘Lorna Doone,’ Stevenson’s marvelous sketch
of Villon in the ‘New Arabian Nights,’ and Thomas Hardy’s ‘Tess of the
D’Urbervilles.’... It is probably owing to this extreme care that ‘Many
Inventions’ is undoubtedly Mr. Kipling’s best book.”&mdash;<i>Chicago Post.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Kipling’s style is too well known to American readers to require
introduction, but it can scarcely be amiss to say there is not a story in this
collection that does not more than repay a perusal of them all.”&mdash;<i>Baltimore
American.</i></p>

<p>“As a writer of short stories Rudyard Kipling is a genius. He has had
imitators, but they have not been successful in dimming the luster of his
achievements by contrast.... ‘Many Inventions’ is the title. And they
are inventions&mdash;entirely original in incident, ingenious in plot, and startling
by their boldness and force.”&mdash;<i>Rochester Herald.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
